name: sprint-testing
description: "Orchestrates in-sprint manual QA per issue across Stages 1 (Planning), 2 (Execution) and 3 (Reporting). Use for user-story testing, bug retesting, and sprint-wide QA loops. Creates the PBI folder, drives session-start, runs the triage + veto + risk-score decision tree on bugs, produces the ATP + ATR + TC artifacts in the TMS, executes smoke and trifuerza (UI/API/DB) exploration, and files the final QA comment + bug reports. Triggers on: test this ticket, QA this user story, retest this bug, verify bug fix, run exploratory testing, smoke test a feature, process the sprint, plan the sprint QA backlog, next ticket in sprint, resume sprint testing, continue-from a ticket. Do NOT use for Stage 4 TMS documentation + ROI (test-documentation), Stage 5 automation coding (test-automation), Stage 6 regression suite execution (regression-testing), or onboarding a new repo (project-discovery)."

compact_rules: |
  - AC-pass is the FLOOR, not the goal. Coverage = AC-conformance + risk-beyond-AC (boundaries, errors, states, anomalies). Never report "% of ACs verified" as completeness. (Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`.)
  - 1:N is the default: explode every non-trivial AC into multiple cases (EP partitions + boundaries + states + contexts). Collapsing an AC to one case requires a written "trivially atomic" justification.
  - Apply techniques by trigger: EP always; BVA wherever a range / limit / length / date-window exists; State-Transition for stateful entities; Decision Table when 2+ conditions interact; Pairwise when 3+ combinable factors (log the reduction); Error-Guessing charters for experience-based risk.
  - A criterion is a business assertion; a test case is a concrete exploration of it. Run the Test-Design Checklist before finalizing the ATP.
  - CLASSIFY before filing — stop hardcoding "Bug". **Bug** = affected feature already live above Staging (end-user visible); **Defect** = feature still pre-release (Staging or below), the normal output of sprint testing; **Improvement** = not a broken AC (an enhancement, or an under-specified/absent AC surfaced by a test-beyond-AC). Classification follows the FEATURE's lifecycle stage, not where the problem was found. (Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md` Part 1.)
  - `qa_assignee` (`{{jira.qa_assignee}}`) = the authenticated session user (self-assign). Set it when a Story is TAKEN INTO TESTING (start_testing) and on every filed Bug / Defect / Improvement. NEVER-OVERWRITE an existing owner (read-before-write); distinct from the native dev `assignee` (Part 2).
  - `components` (native, MANDATORY) = the affected product module/Epic, must pre-exist in the Jira Components module (Part 3).
  - Three-axis model: **parent** = QA Defect Management process epic (`qa.qa_epics.defect_epic`, found-or-created — NEVER a product/dev epic, NEVER the Story); **issue link** = the source Story (traceability); **components** = product module (Part 4).
  - `priority` (native) is auto-derived from `{{jira.severity}}` (critica→Highest, mayor→High, moderada→Medium, menor→Low, trivial→Lowest); override with a 1-line justification (Part 5.1).
  - Three stages, always in order: Stage 1 Planning → Stage 2 Execution → Stage 3 Reporting. Hand off Stages 4/5/6 to `test-documentation` / `test-automation` / `regression-testing`.
  - Jira is source of truth. Read tickets via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments`, then the synced `.md`. NEVER `acli workitem view` for custom fields (returns `null`).
  - Bugs run the veto + triage + risk-score decision tree BEFORE any ATP is written.
  - Execution = smoke pass first, then trifuerza (UI/API/DB) exploration; capture evidence under the PBI folder.
  - API testing = three-tool maneuver: OpenAPI MCP for schema (READ-ONLY) → `bun run api:login` for the token (→ `.auth/tokens.env`) → **curl** for authenticated requests. NEVER execute via the OpenAPI MCP. Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/api-testing-doctrine.md`.
  - Consult `domain-glossary.md` (if present) before authoring the ATP, refined ACs, and TC outlines.
  - On any subagent failure: STOP, report partial state, offer retry / skip-stage / abort. No auto-fix, no auto-rollback.
  - Stage 1 Set-first order (Modality jira-xray — AUTHORITATIVE): the Story's coverage backbone is its **ATS** (`ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}` — mandatory per Story, even with a single TC; parent: QA Test Artifacts epic; components inherited from the Story). Create the sprint `Test` issues, put ALL of them in the ATS, and link **ATS→Story** via the `test` slug (Story `is tested by` ATS) — the PRIMARY coverage-bearing edge (fills the Xray coverage panel); a direct TC→Story link is the only other coverage-bearing edge (last resort, valid only when no ATS can exist); Story↔ATP and Story↔ATR links are administrative traceability with ZERO coverage.
  - The ATP item is find-or-created FROM the `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field (where shift-left authored it) — pre-sprint the ATP lives ONLY in that field; Stage 1 is where the Test Plan item is born (parent: QA Master Test Plan epic).
  - Derive, never re-list: the ATP's and the ATR Execution's test lists are DERIVED from the ATS membership — never maintained as independent id lists (three hand-maintained lists drift silently and corrupt coverage).
  - ATR always with environment (HARD GATE): create the ATR / retest Execution ALWAYS carrying the Test Environment resolved from `active_env` in `.agents/project.yaml` (or the session env switch). No ATR without environment — an environment-less Execution fails the Stage-1 DoD gate (`agentic-qa-core/references/stage-gates.md`).
  - TC∈ATS / TC∈ATP / TC∈ATR membership is Xray-internal (GraphQL) — NEVER expressed as Jira issue links in Modality jira-xray. Do NOT link TCs directly to the Story (last-resort only, for instances with no Test Set work type).
  - Bug retest (Modality jira-xray): ONE repro `Test` by default, created at fix-verification time (Stage 2), linked Bug↔Test via the `test` slug and executed in the retest Execution (`ReTest: {BUG_KEY}: {summary}`); 1:N only with a written test-design justification. Modality jira-native: no in-sprint TCs (the bug is the immediate retest case) — persistent-Test decisions defer to Stage 4.
  - STP find-or-create fires on the sprint's FIRST ticket: `STP: Sprint#{N}: {objective}` (Test Plan item, parent: QA Master Test Plan; a LIVING planner — append each tested ticket, keep progress current). The sprint recap Execution `STR: Sprint#{N}: Regression Testing` (parent: QA Test Artifacts) is created at sprint close.
  - Two modes, ASKED at Session Start, never inferred: **sprint-wide** (the whole sprint's QA backlog) or **single-issue** (one issue from it). Only `sprint-wide` creates/updates the STP and the sprint session pair; `single-issue` creates neither.
  - `sprint-wide` is a REAL session scope, not a folder: `.session/sprint-testing/sprint-<N>/{plan.md, progress.md}` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §6/§7, holding one nested `<JIRA-KEY>/` sub-scope per issue. `plan.md` is the local STP (queue + waves + assignment); `progress.md` is the append-only sprint log, one entry per issue close. There is NO local sprint tracker file — anything the team needs lives in the STP in Jira.
  - Sprint scope is a JQL QUERY, never a hardcoded issue-type list: take the work types declared `coverable: true` in `.agents/jira-required.yaml`, resolve each one's `jira_issue_type` (`A | B | C` = ordered alternatives, first the instance has wins), intersect with `.agents/jira-workflows.json`. A declared type the instance lacks is SKIPPED WITH A NOTE, never a blocker.
  - STP maintenance parity (concurrent testers): `plan.md` ↔ the STP issue DESCRIPTION — rewritten wholesale, so ONE writer (whoever plans the sprint), read-first before writing. `progress.md` ↔ the STP issue COMMENTS — append-only on both sides, one comment per issue close, so two testers never clobber each other. Where the comment log and a Story's ATR disagree, the **ATR wins** — it is the artifact of record.

## Forbidden invocations

**NEVER invoke `/sdd-*` skills from this workflow.** SDD is an optional
user-installed ceremony; this skill ships self-contained and does not chain
SDD under any condition. If you need to refactor KATA, fixtures, cli/,
scripts/, or api/schemas/ pipeline, exit this skill first and invoke
`/framework-development` — which itself runs Plan → Code → Verify → Archive
natively (no SDD required).

This boundary is mechanical, not advisory: `scripts/lint-skills.ts` rejects
any `/sdd-` mention outside this section. See:
`.agents/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md` §4
(governs users who manually install SDD).

# Sprint Testing — Plan, Execute, Report per Ticket

Drive the manual / exploratory QA loop for a single ticket during a sprint. Three stages, always in this order: **Stage 1 Planning -> Stage 2 Execution -> Stage 3 Reporting**. Hand off afterwards to the skills that own Stage 4, 5 and 6.

The same three-stage pipeline runs in every mode. Only the entry point and the bookkeeping differ: one issue at a time (**single-issue**), or the whole sprint's QA backlog driven by a sprint-level session pair (**sprint-wide**).

"Issue", not "story", throughout: Story, Bug, Defect, Improvement, Tech Story and Tech Debt are all coverable, and the sprint queue holds whichever of them the project declares.

## Dependencies

Requires `agentic-qa-core`. Loads on demand:

- `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md` — **MANDATORY before designing any ATP / TC coverage from acceptance criteria.** Governs the 5 principles, the floor-not-ceiling coverage model, the 1:N explode-default rule, and the formal-technique triggers.
- `agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md` — **MANDATORY before taking a Story into testing and before filing any Bug / Defect / Improvement.** Governs issue-type classification (Bug vs Defect vs Improvement by feature lifecycle), the QA-Assignee self-assign + never-overwrite rule, mandatory Components, the three-axis model (parent = QA process epic · link = source Story · components = product module), and Severity→Priority auto-derive.
- `agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`, `agentic-qa-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md`, `agentic-qa-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md`, `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md`, `agentic-qa-core/references/preflight-gate.md`, `agentic-qa-core/references/adr-doctrine.md` — cited inline by the sections that use them.

## Compact Rules

**Test-design doctrine (binding — full canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`):**

- AC-pass is the FLOOR, not the goal. Coverage = AC-conformance + risk-beyond-AC (boundaries, errors, states, anomalies). Never report "% of ACs verified" as completeness.
- 1:N is the default: explode every non-trivial AC into multiple cases (EP partitions + boundaries + states + contexts). Collapsing an AC to one case requires a written "trivially atomic" justification.
- Apply techniques by trigger: EP always; BVA wherever a range / limit / length / date-window exists; State-Transition for stateful entities; Decision Table when 2+ conditions interact; Pairwise when 3+ combinable factors (log the reduction); Error-Guessing charters for experience-based risk.
- A criterion is a business assertion; a test case is a concrete exploration of it. Run the Test-Design Checklist before finalizing the ATP.

**Defect-management doctrine (binding — full canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md`):**

- CLASSIFY before filing — stop hardcoding "Bug". **Bug** = affected feature already live above Staging (end-user visible); **Defect** = feature still pre-release (Staging or below), the normal output of sprint testing; **Improvement** = not a broken AC (an enhancement, or an under-specified/absent AC surfaced by a test-beyond-AC). Classification follows the FEATURE's lifecycle stage, not where the problem was found (Part 1).
- `qa_assignee` (`{{jira.qa_assignee}}`) = the authenticated session user (self-assign). Set it when a Story is TAKEN INTO TESTING (start_testing) and on every filed Bug / Defect / Improvement. NEVER-OVERWRITE an existing owner (read-before-write); distinct from the native dev `assignee` (Part 2).
- `components` (native, MANDATORY) = the affected product module/Epic, must pre-exist in the Jira Components module (Part 3).
- Three-axis model: **parent** = QA Defect Management process epic (`qa.qa_epics.defect_epic`, found-or-created — NEVER a product/dev epic, NEVER the Story); **issue link** = the source Story (traceability); **components** = product module (Part 4).
- `priority` (native) is auto-derived from `{{jira.severity}}` (critica→Highest, mayor→High, moderada→Medium, menor→Low, trivial→Lowest); override with a 1-line justification (Part 5.1).

**Sprint-testing operational rules:**

- Three stages, always in order: Stage 1 Planning → Stage 2 Execution → Stage 3 Reporting. Hand off Stages 4/5/6 to `test-documentation` / `test-automation` / `regression-testing`.
- Jira is source of truth. Read tickets via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments`, then the synced `.md`. NEVER `acli workitem view` for custom fields (returns `null`).
- Bugs run the veto + triage + risk-score decision tree BEFORE any ATP is written.
- Execution = smoke pass first, then trifuerza (UI/API/DB) exploration; capture evidence under the PBI folder.
- API testing = three-tool maneuver: OpenAPI MCP for schema (READ-ONLY) → `bun run api:login` for the token (→ `.auth/tokens.env`) → **curl** for authenticated requests. NEVER execute via the OpenAPI MCP. Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/api-testing-doctrine.md`.
- Consult `domain-glossary.md` (if present) before authoring the ATP, refined ACs, and TC outlines.
- On any subagent failure: STOP, report partial state, offer retry / skip-stage / abort. No auto-fix, no auto-rollback.
- Two modes, ASKED at Session Start, never inferred: **sprint-wide** (the whole sprint's QA backlog) or **single-issue** (one issue from it). Only `sprint-wide` creates the sprint session pair `.session/sprint-testing/sprint-<N>/{plan.md, progress.md}` and the STP; `single-issue` creates neither.
- The sprint scope is a JQL query built from the work types declared `coverable: true` in `.agents/jira-required.yaml`, intersected with what `.agents/jira-workflows.json` says the instance actually has. Never a hardcoded issue-type list.

## Inputs — read these first, in this order

Canonical reading order for any AI starting cold on a sprint-testing workflow. Read in order; stop earlier when the ticket is small enough that later inputs add no signal.

1. `.agents/project.yaml` — project identity, env URLs, `{{PROJECT_KEY}}`, MCP names, active environment.
2. `.agents/jira-required.yaml` — canonical slug catalog (custom fields, statuses, transitions) for the active workspace.
3. `.agents/jira-fields.json` — slug → numeric custom-field-ID mapping for `{{jira.<slug>}}` resolution at runtime.
4. `.agents/jira-workflows.json` — workflow + transition catalog, **the authoritative source of every status / transition name** (resolves Ready For QA → In Test → QA Approved for Story / Bug / Test Case work types). A status that is not in this file does not exist in the instance.
5. `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/context.md` — ticket-local context: session notes, open questions (hand-authored; read if it already exists from a prior Session Start). NON-Jira file — never a Jira mirror.
6. `.context/master-test-plan.md` — regression Epic pointer, modality decision (Xray vs Jira-native), what to test and why.
7. `.context/business/business-feature-map.md` — feature catalog vocabulary; resolves "what epic owns this story" for the `epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/` PBI folder naming (module = Epic, 1:1).
8. `.context/business/domain-glossary.md` (if present) — canonical domain vocabulary; consult BEFORE authoring the ATP, refined ACs, and TC outlines so test names, entity terms, and Gherkin wording use canonical terms and avoid anti-glossary banned terms. If a new or ambiguous term surfaces during testing, flag it in the Stage 3 QA comment for the PM to add via the glossary's change protocol — NEVER edit the glossary from a testing session.
9. The Story or Bug ticket itself — AC, ATP, comments — read via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments`, then read the synced `.md` files (`story.md`, `acceptance-criteria.md`, `acceptance-test-plan.md`, `comments.md`) under the STORY folder. Jira is source-of-truth; the synced `.md` is a read-only cache. NEVER `acli workitem view` for custom fields — it returns `null`.
10. `.env` — `LOCAL_USER_*` / `STAGING_USER_*` credentials. NEVER hardcode; always read at runtime.
11. `kata-manifest.json` — registry of existing KATA Components + ATCs. Check before proposing new ATCs in Stage 3 hand-off so the test-automation phase doesn't duplicate work.

**Optional inputs.** `master-test-plan.md`, the business maps, and `domain-glossary.md` frequently arrive after `/project-discovery` runs and may be absent — proceed without them and surface a `missing_input` note in the Stage 1 ATP so a later pass can fill the gap. `kata-manifest.json` is only load-bearing at the Stage 3 → `test-automation` hand-off; skip in pure manual-QA invocations.

## Subagent Dispatch Strategy

> **Orchestration & Session contracts**: this skill follows `agentic-qa-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md` (mandatory subagent dispatch — main thread is command center) AND `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` (Phase 0 resume check, plan-first persistence at `.session/<skill-slug>/<scope>/`, archive on completion). Phase 0 (resume check) and Phase 1 (plan write) are NOT optional. The orchestrator also applies the per-stage **Definition-of-Done gates** in `agentic-qa-core/references/stage-gates.md`: verify a stage's DoD (planning stages include the Test-Design Checklist) BEFORE recording its progress checkpoint and advancing.

This skill runs at two altitudes, and each is a real session scope per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §3 + §9 (§9 "Nested scopes"):

```
.session/sprint-testing/
├── <JIRA-KEY>/              # single-issue mode
│   ├── plan.md  progress.md  test-session-memory.md
└── sprint-<N>/              # sprint-wide mode
    ├── plan.md              # the local STP: scope, waves, assignment
    ├── progress.md          # append-only sprint log, one entry per issue close
    └── <JIRA-KEY>/          # per-issue sub-scope, identical to single-issue
        └── plan.md  progress.md  test-session-memory.md
```

**Single-issue** mode: `<scope>` = `<JIRA-KEY>` (e.g. `UPEX-123`). **Sprint-wide** mode: the sprint scope is `sprint-<N>` and each issue's scope is `sprint-<N>/<JIRA-KEY>`. Both `plan.md` files follow the §6 schema and both `progress.md` files the §7 append-only schema — one file format, two altitudes. What a "phase" means is the only difference: at issue altitude a phase is a stage of this skill, at sprint altitude a phase is one issue in the queue.

`test-session-memory.md` exists at the ISSUE altitude only and is a SEPARATE concern from `plan.md`: it carries TMS modality + issue context + stage state shared across the 4 sub-agent dispatches (domain memory). All three coexist per issue — `plan.md` indexes the session, `progress.md` decides the next stage, `test-session-memory.md` holds the cross-stage shared payload.

This skill is compliant with the doctrine in `AGENTS.md` §"Orchestration Mode (Subagent Strategy)" and the session contract in `.agents/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md`. Every dispatch follows the 7-component briefing format defined in `.agents/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`, and the pattern selected per stage matches the decision guide in `.agents/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md`. This skill operates in two modes (single-issue and sprint-wide) and BOTH modes use the same four dispatch points per issue — Session Start -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3. The only difference is that sprint-wide loops them once per issue. The full briefings (Goal / Context docs / Project Standards (auto-resolved) / Skills to load / Exact instructions / Report format / Rules) live in `references/sprint-orchestration.md` §"Sub-agent prompt templates".

| Stage                                              | Pattern    | Subagent role                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Session Start (per-issue)                          | Single     | dispatch a session-start subagent: fetch the issue from the issue tracker, load `.context/`, create the PBI folder + `context.md` and the session dir + `test-session-memory.md`, return issue summary + AC list |
| Stage 1 — Planning (ATP + draft TCs + risk triage) | Sequential | dispatch a Planning subagent: produce the ATP artifact + risk score + draft TC outlines; bug tickets get the veto + triage decision tree applied                                |
| Stage 2 — Execution (smoke + UI/API/DB exploration)| Sequential | dispatch an Execution subagent: smoke pass first, then triforce (UI/API/DB) exploration; capture evidence under the PBI folder; surface BUG_FOUND if applicable                  |
| Stage 3 — Reporting (ATR + QA comment + transition)| Sequential | dispatch a Reporting subagent: fill the ATR, post the QA comment, transition the issue, file bug reports if any                                                                 |

> **Modes are equivalent in dispatch shape**. Single-issue mode runs ONE pass through these four dispatches. Sprint-wide loops them per issue. There is no longer a "single-issue inline" path — both modes pay the same 4-dispatch cost so behavior is uniform and reviews are consistent.

> **Sequential, not Parallel**: each stage feeds the next (Session Start's PBI folder is read by Stage 1; Stage 1's ATP is read by Stage 2; Stage 2's evidences are read by Stage 3). Parallelism inside a single issue would race on shared PBI state.

> **On any subagent failure**: STOP, report the partial state (which stages completed, what artifacts landed), present retry / skip-stage / abort options. Do NOT auto-fix nor auto-rollback. See `.agents/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md`.

---

## Scope — ASK for the mode first

| Mode | Input | Output | Use when |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **single-issue — User Story** | One story key (e.g. `{{PROJECT_KEY}}-123`) | ATP + ATR + QA comment + issue moved to {{jira.status.story.qa_approved}}. TC artifacts depend on modality: jira-native → outlines only (regression TCs created in Stage 4); jira-xray → created + executed `Test`s this sprint, promoted to regression in Stage 4 (see "TC creation timing") | Full QA on one story end to end |
| **single-issue — Bug** | One bug key | Triage decision, then either Code-Review-only OR ATP + ATR + verification report | Retesting a bug fix on staging |
| **sprint-wide** | Sprint number `N` | Sprint session pair (`plan.md` queue + append-only `progress.md`) · STP found-or-created and maintained · per-issue artifacts · session summary | Running the whole sprint's QA backlog, with interruption + resume support |

### The mode question (MANDATORY — asked, never inferred)

Session Start asks this explicitly, in one question, before anything else:

> Run **the whole sprint's QA backlog** (`sprint-wide`), or **one issue from it** (`single-issue`)?

A sprint number in the invocation is a strong hint, not an answer — "QA sprint 12" can mean either. Ask, then apply:

| Answer | Sprint session pair | STP | Per-issue sub-scopes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sprint-wide` | created at `.session/sprint-testing/sprint-<N>/` | found-or-created and kept current | `sprint-<N>/<JIRA-KEY>/`, one per issue |
| `single-issue` | **not created** | **not created** (exactly as today) | `<JIRA-KEY>/` at the top level |

### Sprint scope is a JQL query, never a hardcoded type list

The sprint's QA backlog is resolved by QUERY. **NEVER write a literal issue-type list as the rule** — a project whose Jira has only `Story` must work, and so must one that added `Tech Debt`. Resolve it in four steps:

1. Read `.agents/jira-required.yaml` and take every work type declared `coverable: true`.
2. For each, resolve `jira_issue_type`. A value of the form `A | B | C` is an **ordered list of alternatives** — the first name the instance actually has wins (the `subtask` entry documents the established pattern and why: the subtask level is spelled `Sub-task`, `Task` or `Subtarea` depending on the instance).
3. Intersect with `.agents/jira-workflows.json`, the synced catalog of what the instance really exposes. A work type absent from that file does not exist here.
4. A declared type the instance lacks is **SKIPPED WITH A NOTE** in the sprint `plan.md` §Risks. It is never a blocker and never a reason to stop.

The JQL is then built from the surviving names plus the sprint filter. *Illustrative only — do NOT copy this list into the plan or any reference:* on an instance that happens to expose all six coverable types, step 4 yields `sprint = {N} AND project = {{PROJECT_KEY}} AND issuetype in (Story, Bug, Defect, Improvement, "Tech Story", "Tech Debt")`. On an instance with only `Story` it yields `issuetype = Story`, and that is a correct, complete run.

Execute it with `bun run jira:sync-issues jql "<query>"` (resolves every slug and materializes the per-issue `.md`), or `pull --sprint <N> --types <csv>` for the same roster.

## Workflow — one pipeline for all modes

```
Session Start (always first)
    -> PBI folder + context.md · session dir + test-session-memory.md
    -> Story explanation, WAIT for user OK

Stage 1 — Planning
    -> For Story: triage risk + Test Analysis + ATP/ATR + TC OUTLINES (names + 1-line precond/expected)
                  jira-native -> NO `Test` work items here (created in Stage 4, regression-worthy only)
                  jira-xray   -> Set-first order (see "Stage 1 Set-first order" below): ① CREATE +
                                 EXECUTE `Test` issues at executable detail + the Story's ATS (Test
                                 Set) created/updated holding ALL of them ② ATP item find-or-created
                                 FROM the {{jira.acceptance_test_plan}} field content ③ ATP/ATR test
                                 lists DERIVED from the ATS membership ④ ATR always created WITH the
                                 Test Environment.
                                 Stage 4 promotes the regression-worthy ones into the Regression Test Plan.
    -> For Bug:   veto check + Bug Analysis + ATP/ATR.
                  jira-xray   -> ONE repro `Test` by default, created at fix-verification time (1:N
                                 only if the scope genuinely covers distinct conditions — justify per
                                 test-design-doctrine), executed in the retest Execution, PASSED/FAILED
                                 recorded. Bug↔Test linked via the `test` slug (Bug is coverable).
                  jira-native -> no TCs in-sprint (the bug IS the immediate retest case; defers to
                                 Stage 4). If regression-worthy, Stage 4 ensures a persistent Test
                                 covers it — REUSE the existing failed Test or CREATE one (golden
                                 rule; both modalities).

### TC creation timing (modality-aware) — AUTHORITATIVE

> Resolves the one question that decides this skill's whole shape: *when does a test case become a work item in the TMS?* Guiding principle: **a test is persisted into the REGRESSION repository because it will be re-executed (manual or automated), never to hit a count.** The mechanism differs by modality because the TMS tools differ — an Xray `Test` issue is an **execution unit**, a Jira-native `Test` issue is **documentation**.

**Key distinction:** an **execution artifact** (how you run + record a test this sprint) is NOT the **regression repository** (the curated set of repeatable tests). The principle governs the repository, not the sprint execution artifacts.

| | **Modality jira-native** | **Modality jira-xray** (`bun xray` CLI) |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 1 (Planning) | TC **outlines only** (names + 1-line precond/expected in the ATP). **No `Test` work items** — a native `Test` issue IS documentation, so it waits for the Stage-4 regression-worthy gate. | **ASK the format once per batch** (see "Test-case format — ask once per batch" below), then **create + execute** Xray `Test` issues for the **planned outlines**, at *executable* detail (preconditions + runnable steps), and run them via a **Test Execution** — all in one pass. By Xray's plugin design the `Test` is the execution unit, so generating these artifacts is what makes the rest of the Xray flow work. All created Tests are aggregated into the Story's **ATS** and the Plan/Execution lists derive from that membership (see "Stage 1 Set-first order" below). **Manual** tests are created **without inline steps**, then steps are added one-by-one (see "Manual Xray test steps — two-step creation"). |

#### Test-case format — ask once per batch (Modality jira-xray, Stage 1) — AUTHORITATIVE

Before creating the batch of Xray `Test` issues, **ASK THE USER ONCE PER BATCH** which test-case format to use, and apply the chosen format to **the whole batch**:

- **Manual** — Xray `type=Manual`; step / data / expected-result steps (human-readable, no Gherkin).
- **Gherkin / Cucumber** — Xray `type=Cucumber`; Scenario / Scenario Outline + Examples.

Default *suggestion* (the user still picks): **Gherkin** for automation-candidate flows, **Manual** for exploratory / human-judgment scenarios. State the suggestion, then wait for the user's choice — do not auto-pick. This Stage-1 ask is a sprint-execution convenience; it does NOT pre-empt the Stage-4 ROI verdict→format mapping in `test-documentation` (Candidate→Gherkin, Manual→Manual), which governs the **persistent regression** repository.

#### Manual Xray test steps — two-step creation (Modality jira-xray) — AUTHORITATIVE

Xray Cloud **silently drops** steps passed inline to `test create`. So whenever the batch format is **Manual**, create each Test in **two steps**, never inline:

1. **Create** the `Test` (`type=Manual`) WITHOUT inline steps — `[TMS_TOOL] Create Test: type=Manual, title=...` (no `steps=`).
2. **Add each step one-by-one** via `[TMS_TOOL] Add Test Step` (action / data / expected per step) — the `/xray-cli` skill carries the concrete CLI syntax.

Optionally **verify** with `[TMS_TOOL] Get Test` that the steps landed. Gherkin/Cucumber Tests are unaffected (the Gherkin is one field) — this two-step rule applies to **Manual** tests only.

#### Stage 1 Set-first order (Modality jira-xray) — AUTHORITATIVE

The Story's coverage backbone is its **ATS** (Acceptance Test Set — `ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}`, `{US_ID}` = the Story key; mandatory per Story, even with a single TC). Stage 1 runs in THIS order:

1. **ATS holding ALL the Story's TCs.** Create the sprint `Test` issues, then create/update the Story's ATS (parent: **QA Test Artifacts** epic; **components inherited from the Story — mandatory**) with ALL of them as members, and link **ATS→Story** via the `test` slug (`{{jira.link_types.test}}`, Story `is tested by` ATS). This link is what fills the Xray coverage panel (live-verified); the ATP→Story and ATR→Story links are administrative traceability only and contribute ZERO coverage.
2. **ATP item FROM the field (find-or-create).** Pre-sprint the ATP lives ONLY in `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` — the shift-left pass is field-first and does NOT create the item. Find-or-create the Test Plan issue `ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}` (parent: **QA Master Test Plan** epic) and seed its description from the field content; if the field is empty (no shift-left pass), author the ATP normally and write both the item and the field.
3. **Derive, never re-list.** The ATP's test list and the ATR Execution's test list are DERIVED from the ATS membership — never maintained as three independent id lists.
4. **ATR always with environment.** Create the ATR Execution (`ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing`, parent: **QA Test Artifacts**) ALWAYS carrying the Test Environment resolved from `active_env` in `.agents/project.yaml` (or the session env switch). **No ATR without environment** — hard gate: `agentic-qa-core/references/stage-gates.md` §Stage 1.

TC∈ATS / TC∈ATP / TC∈ATR membership is Xray-internal (GraphQL) — NEVER expressed as Jira issue links in this modality. In jira-native, an instance WITH the Test Set work type expresses membership as `TC→ATS` issue links (explicit carve-out from the no-membership-links rule, which is xray-only); an instance WITHOUT it has no ATS — fall back to direct `TC→Story` links.

Intended stage asymmetry (not drift): in-sprint Stage 1 creates the TCs first and groups them into the ATS incrementally as they land, while Stage 4 module-driven (`test-documentation`) pre-creates the containers before the first TC because parallel sharding needs the targets to exist.
| Stage 2 (Execution) | Run planned outlines **+ explore beyond them**; track outline status (PASS/FAIL) in `test-session-memory.md`. | Execute the created Tests in the Test Execution; **explore beyond them**. A throwaway exploratory probe becomes a `Test` ONLY if it found a defect or is worth repeating — otherwise it stays as session evidence / a bug, NOT a `Test` (avoid one-shot-Test explosion). |
| Stage 4 (`test-documentation`) | **Create** `Test` work items **only for regression-worthy** scenarios (Candidate/Manual) after ROI; apply the feature/Epic label (native's organizer — no Test Set entity). Deferred → report only, no TMS `Test`. | **Select + promote**: from the sprint Xray Tests, the regression-worthy ones (Candidate/Manual) get **enriched** (rich Gherkin, parameterization, edge elaboration), **labelled** `regression-candidate`, **added to the feature Test Set** (1:1 Epic, created lazily if missing) **and the Regression Test Plan**. Deferred sprint Tests stay tied to their Test Execution as historical record — **not promoted, not deleted**. |

**Invariants (both modalities):**
- The **persistent regression set** is ROI-gated in Stage 4, never assumed in Stage 1.
- The wide 1:N technique derivation feeds the ATP outlines + execution — in native it stays as outlines; in Xray it materializes as sprint `Test` artifacts. Either way it does NOT auto-populate the regression repository.
- Heavy specification ("specify much more") is spent only on Stage-4 regression candidates, never on Deferred scenarios.

See `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md` (derive widely) + `test-documentation` Three-Outcomes (persist narrowly).
       Stage 6 -> regression-testing
```

Session-start is the universal entry. **Single-issue mode runs the same 4 dispatches as sprint-wide**: Session Start -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3. The orchestrator dispatches them sequentially (each subagent's report feeds the next briefing's "Context docs"). The full briefings live in `references/sprint-orchestration.md`. Use them verbatim — do NOT inline any stage just because there is only one issue. Sprint-wide loops these same four dispatches through the `PENDING` rows of the sprint `plan.md` queue and, after each issue closes, appends one entry to the sprint `progress.md` and one comment to the STP.

---

## Readiness Preflight Gate (MANDATORY — runs before Phase 0)

> Full doctrine: `agentic-qa-core/references/preflight-gate.md`. Runs FIRST, before the resume check. Two laws: (1) **args-as-answers** — "QA UPEX-123 on staging" already answers env + scope; "test the login API" already answers the surface (API). Ask only the gaps. (2) **probe, don't assume** — a configured MCP is RED until it actually answers. Surface gaps + REDs as ONE `AskUserQuestion` checklist; self-fix with approval + explanation; STOP on any blocking RED. This is the heaviest gate in the repo because Stage 2 exercises UI + API + DB live. **Generic baseline** (env resolution, test-user creds, secret/restart handling, the two laws, output contract) is inherited from the reference §3.1 — not repeated here. Below is only this skill's **specific capability delta**.

| Capability | Need | Why here |
|---|---|---|
| Framework adapted (artifacts present) | REQUIRED | Live QA needs the project wired — `{{WEB_URL}}` / MCP names are `null` on a generic boilerplate. Probe the reference §4 ADAPTED signals; still generic → STOP and tell the user to run `/project-discovery` → `/adapt-framework` themselves. The gate NEVER auto-runs them. |
| Active env reachable | REQUIRED | Authoring an ATP against a dead env is the highest-cost waste. Probe `{{WEB_URL}}` + `{{API_URL}}` root. This subsumes the env half of Session Start §0.6 — pulled to t=0. |
| Test-user credentials + roles | REQUIRED | `<<ACTIVE_ENV>>` creds in `.env`. Ask how many roles the ticket needs; one token per role via `scripts/api-login.ts`. |
| Issue-tracker (`[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`) + TMS modality | REQUIRED | All ATP/ATR/QA-comment/transition writes go to Jira. Load `/acli`; resolve modality; load `/xray-cli` + `XRAY_*` if jira-xray. |
| OpenAPI MCP (schema read-only) | SCOPE — when API surface is in scope | The `openapi` MCP is **schema-read-only** — discover endpoints + read schemas (`list-api-endpoints` / `get-api-endpoint-schema`); it does NOT execute authenticated requests. Probe that a schema call returns the spec. Generic/unset spec → `/adapt-framework`. Execution is curl's job (next row). |
| API token for curl (`bun run api:login`) | SCOPE — when API execution is in scope | Authenticated requests run via **curl**, not the MCP. Mint: `bun run api:login [<env>] [--role <role>]` → `.auth/tokens.env`. Execute: `source .auth/tokens.env && curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN_<ROLE>_<ENV>" "$API_BASE_URL/<path>"`. **No restart needed** (the token never enters an MCP). Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/api-testing-doctrine.md`. |
| DBHub MCP | SCOPE — when DB validation is in scope | The trifuerza DB leg. Probe `dbhub` lists schema/tables; `DBHUB_*` in `.env`. Unset → user fills `.env` + RESTART (spawn-time). |
| Playwright / `/playwright-cli` | SCOPE — when UI surface is in scope | Smoke + UI exploration. Browser present (`bun run pw:install` if not). |
| Email (`resend`) — can RECEIVE | SCOPE — magic-link / auth-token tickets only | Subsumes the inbox half of Session Start §0.6. A send-only provider cannot complete a magic-link flow → STOP before Stage 1. |
| `kata-manifest.json` | OPTIONAL | Only load-bearing at the Stage 3 → `/test-automation` handoff (anti-duplication). |

Surfaces (UI / API / DB / code-review-only) are decided by **Stage 1 Planning's triage + veto + risk-scoring** — NEVER asked of the user (reference §5). The gate only probes and reports which surface tools are ready; Stage 1 reads that report and picks the trifuerza subset on its own. A scope-conditional tool stays REQUIRED only once Stage 1 selects its surface — if RED then, surface the remedy at that point. Session Start §0.6 stays as written — this gate is its t=0 generalization, not a replacement. After the gate clears (generic baseline + any already-evident surface tools GREEN), continue to Phase 0 below.

---

## Phase 0 — Session resume check (MANDATORY, inline)

Before Session Start dispatch, run the resume contract from `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §4:

1. Compute prospective `<scope>` from the mode answer: `<JIRA-KEY>` (single-issue) or `sprint-<N>` then `sprint-<N>/<JIRA-KEY>` (sprint-wide — see the two-altitude note below).
2. Check `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/progress.md`.
3. If it does NOT exist → proceed to Session Start (writes `plan.md`).
4. If it DOES exist:
   - Read `plan.md` + tail of `progress.md`.
   - Optionally read `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/test-session-memory.md` for the per-issue domain state (load-bearing across the 4 sub-agent dispatches; issue altitude only).
   - Surface to the user: last completed stage (Session Start / Stage 1 / Stage 2 / Stage 3) — or, at sprint altitude, the last closed issue and the next `PENDING` one — plus any unresolved BUG_FOUND or TOOL FAILURE from the last entry.
   - Offer **resume / restart / abort**. On `restart`, archive to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-sprint-testing-<scope>-aborted/` first.

**Sprint-wide runs Phase 0 twice over, at two altitudes** (`agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §9 "Nested scopes"):

- **Once on `sprint-<N>`** at sprint entry. Existing pair → the resume summary is "queue of {n}, {k} closed, next is `<KEY>`". No pair → Session Start §0.5 builds it.
- **Then once per issue on `sprint-<N>/<JIRA-KEY>`**, as the loop enters that issue (NOT once at sprint-loop entry). Per-issue resume keeps sprint progress fine-grained.

`restart` at sprint altitude archives the whole `sprint-<N>/` tree, nested sub-scopes included — never offer it while an issue is mid-flight.

---

## Session Start — the universal entry

Every invocation starts by initializing the session, even in sprint-wide mode. Session Start:

0. **Resolve TMS modality** (Xray on Jira vs Jira-native). By excellence ATP/ATR/ATS are real Jira items — a `Test Plan` issue (`ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}`) parented to the **QA Master Test Plan** epic, a `Test Execution` issue (`ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing`) parented to the **QA Test Artifacts** epic, and a `Test Set` issue (`ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}`, the Story's coverage backbone) also parented to **QA Test Artifacts**; the Story custom-field + comment mirror (Modality jira-native) is a **fallback ONLY** when those work types are unavailable. Pre-sprint the ATP lives ONLY in the `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field — Stage 1 is where the Test Plan item is born (find-or-create from the field). The modality probe decides which path is live. Title grammar + epic parenting + the Feature-altitude FTP name: `references/acceptance-test-planning.md`. Full resolution algorithm lives in `test-documentation/SKILL.md` §Phase 0 — apply the same four-step probe here (AGENTS.md -> master-test-plan.md -> list issue types -> ask the user). Persist the result into `test-session-memory.md`.
0.1. **Load required tool skills** — based on the TMS modality resolved in Step 0:
   - Always load `/acli` (Jira WRITE operations: comment, transition, link, custom-field update, bug creation). Detailed READS (ACs, ATP/ATR, description, comments) do NOT use `/acli` — they use `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` then read the synced `.md`. See `agentic-qa-core/references/acli-integration.md` §"Reads vs writes".
   - In **Modality jira-xray**: also load `/xray-cli` for Test / Test Execution / Test Plan / Test Run operations and traceability reads.
   - In **Modality jira-native**: `/acli` covers `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` writes and `[TMS_TOOL]` operations — no additional skill needed. Detailed reads still route through the sync script.
   This step is **mandatory before any pseudocode block below executes**. The skills carry the concrete syntax, flags, and JSON payloads this skill intentionally omits.
0.5. **Sprint session pair** (sprint-wide mode only — skip in single-issue mode):
   - The mode came from the §"The mode question" ask, not from guessing at the invocation wording.
   - Phase 0 already checked `.session/sprint-testing/sprint-<N>/progress.md`. Act on what it found:
     - **Missing** -> build the pair before entering the issue loop: resolve the JQL scope (§"Sprint scope is a JQL query"), write `plan.md` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §6, and open `progress.md` with its frontmatter. Procedure: `sprint-orchestration.md` §Part 1 — Sprint plan + STP.
     - **Present** -> resume against it. `plan.md` is NOT regenerated on a schedule: it is the sprint's agreement, and a wholesale rewrite would silently destroy hand-written wave notes and assignments. Newly-arrived issues are appended to the queue and the change is recorded in `## Changelog` (append-only, §6).
   - Single-issue and bug-only invocations skip this step entirely — they own no sprint-altitude state.
0.6. **Environment + inbox preflight** (orchestrator-inline, blocking gate — runs BEFORE Stage 1 authors any ATP):
   - Probe the active environment for reachability: a generic HTTP request to `{{WEB_URL}}` and `{{API_URL}}` root (HEAD or GET, e.g. `curl -sI {{WEB_URL}}`). Expect a 2xx/3xx (a login redirect counts as reachable). A hard failure on root — 404 / 410 / 5xx, connection refused, or a dead-deployment page (`DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` etc.) — means the env is not testable.
   - On hard failure: **STOP and surface to the user before Stage 1.** Do NOT dispatch the Session Start subagent and do NOT author an ATP against a dead env — that is the single highest-cost waste in a run. Offer the user a session env override (see Gotcha 15) if they have a working alternate URL.
   - **Inbox receive-check** (only when the ticket is email / magic-link / auth-token dependent — inferred from the invocation, ticket type, labels, or title): confirm the configured mailbox/provider can actually *receive*, not just send. A send-only provider (e.g. a domain configured for outbound only) cannot complete a magic-link flow. If it cannot receive, STOP and surface before Stage 1.
   - This is a *reachability* gate (is the env even up? can we get the email?), distinct from the Stage 2 smoke test (does the *feature* work?). Both run; they answer different questions — keep anti-pattern S7 and the smoke pass as-is.
0.7. **Sprint Test Plan (STP) find-or-create** (orchestrator-inline; **sprint-wide mode ONLY** — fires on the FIRST ticket of the sprint. In `single-issue` mode SKIP this step entirely: that mode owns no sprint-altitude state and creates no STP, per the scope table above):
   - **Resolve N** from the ticket's Sprint field: `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY>`, then read the sprint value in the generated `.md` (the script also accepts `--sprint <active|current|closed|>=N|7,8,10>` and the `JIRA_SYNC_SPRINTS` env default — that is the sprint-wide path, resolving N once for a whole sprint pull). Issue carries NO sprint → **ASK the user** for N; never guess or invent it.
   - Search for `STP: Sprint#{N}: {objective}` — a **Test Plan** item parented to the **QA Master Test Plan** epic.
   - **Missing** → create it (find-or-create; `/regression-testing` creates it as fallback if it runs suites first). **Present** → UPDATE it: the STP is a LIVING sprint planner — append this ticket to its scope and keep progress current after every tested ticket.
   - It closes at sprint end; the sprint recap Execution `STR: Sprint#{N}: Regression Testing` (parent: **QA Test Artifacts**) is created at sprint close — sprint-wide close recap or `/regression-testing`, whichever arrives first creates it, the other completes it (see `references/sprint-orchestration.md` §STEP 7).
   - Modality jira-native without the Test Plan work type: skip with a note (there is no field fallback at sprint altitude); non-blocking.
   - **STP maintenance under concurrent testers (BINDING).** The sprint session pair and the STP issue are the same artifact at two addresses, and the split is exact:

     | Local file | STP surface | Write mode | Writers |
     |---|---|---|---|
     | `plan.md` | the issue **description** | rewritten wholesale | **ONE** — whoever plans the sprint |
     | `progress.md` | the issue **comments** | **append-only, both sides** | every tester |

     A description is replaced on each write, so two people editing it clobber each other; a comment is added, so two people commenting never can. That is the whole reason the pair is split this way. Read-first before touching the description (never overwrite someone's scope edit), and when an issue closes append ONE comment carrying the same content as that issue's `progress.md` entry.
     **When the comment log and a Story's ATR disagree, the ATR wins** — the ATR is the artifact of record; the comment is a running log that can lag or be written from stale state.
     No new tooling is needed to read the log back: `bun run jira:sync-issues get <STP-KEY> --include-comments` already materializes it locally.
1. Fetches the ticket via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` (title, ACs, priority, comments), then reads the synced `.md` files under the STORY folder. NEVER `acli workitem view` for custom fields.
2. Extracts Team Discussion from the synced `comments.md` (decisions, tech notes, edge cases, blockers). Non-blocking.
3. Loads the project-wide context files: `.context/business/business-data-map.md`, `.context/business/business-feature-map.md`, `.context/business/business-api-map.md`, `.context/master-test-plan.md`.
4. Loads `module-context.md` (3-level hierarchy: project -> module -> ticket) if the sync materialized it; if absent, drafts the body and publishes it into the Epic description's `## Module Context (QA)` section (read-first, never overwrite), then re-syncs — the local file is Jira-synced, never authored by hand (see `references/session-entry-points.md` Step 4).
5. Explores backend (`{{BACKEND_REPO}}`) + frontend (`{{FRONTEND_REPO}}`) code.
6. Finds test data candidates via `[DB_TOOL]` on `{{DB_MCP}}`.
7. Creates the PBI folder and the session directory:
   ```
   .context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-{{PROJECT_KEY}}-{number}-{brief-title}/
     context.md                # hand-authored: session notes + open questions (NON-Jira, local-only)
     evidence/                 # screenshots (NON-Jira, local-only)

   .session/sprint-testing/<scope>/
     test-session-memory.md    # hand-authored: shared memory across the 4 sub-agent dispatches
   ```
   Jira-mirrored files (`story.md`, `acceptance-criteria.md`, `acceptance-test-plan.md`, `acceptance-test-results.md`, `comments.md`, etc.) are NOT hand-written here — they are materialized by `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments`.

   The whole PBI tree is gitignored (it is a Jira cache; see `AGENTS.md` §9), so `context.md` and `evidence/` are local-only by construction. `test-session-memory.md` lives in `.session/` instead because a re-sync rewrites the PBI cache wholesale and this file is what every resume and every sub-agent reads.
8. **Writes the session `plan.md`** at `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/plan.md` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §6 — Goal (one sentence per ticket), Inputs (PBI paths + TMS modality + Team Discussion summary), Approach (mode + per-stage dispatch pattern), Phase breakdown (Session Start / Stage 1 / Stage 2 / Stage 3 with dispatch pointer + exit condition), Risks (from triage), Verification checklist, Cross-references (cites `context.md`, `test-session-memory.md`, `acceptance-test-plan.md`, `acceptance-test-results.md`).
9. Writes a Story Explanation and **STOPS** for user confirmation. Do not proceed until the user OK's.
10. After OK, appends the first progress entry `## Session Start — <ts>` with `status: completed`, `next: Stage 1 — Planning` to `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/progress.md`.

Details, templates and error table live in `references/session-entry-points.md`.

## Mode branches — what changes after Session Start

> Both single-issue and sprint-wide modes run the SAME 4-dispatch cadence (Session Start -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3) per issue. Use the briefings in `references/sprint-orchestration.md` §"Sub-agent prompt templates" verbatim — do NOT inline a stage just because there is only one issue. The previous "single-issue inline" path is **REMOVED**. The notes below describe only what is *different* per issue type or per mode (TMS payload shape, when the sprint log is appended, etc.). The dispatch sequence itself is invariant.

### single-issue, User Story (Stages 1 -> 2 -> 3)

Run the same 4 dispatches. Per-stage payload differences:

- Stage 1 (per "TC creation timing"): Triage risk -> Test Analysis -> ATP/ATR -> **jira-native**: TC **outlines** only, no `Test` work items; **jira-xray**: ask the TC format once per batch (Manual vs Gherkin), then **create + execute** `Test` issues for the planned outlines at executable detail via a Test Execution (Manual tests = create-then-add-step, per "Manual Xray test steps — two-step creation"). Persistent regression TCs are created (native) / promoted (xray) in Stage 4. **Traceability (jira-xray) — Set-first** (per §"Stage 1 Set-first order"): ① the Story's **ATS** (`ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}`) created/updated holding ALL the created TCs, linked **ATS→Story** via the `test` slug — the coverage link ② ATP item find-or-created FROM the `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field ③ ATP/ATR test lists DERIVED from the ATS membership ④ ATR created WITH the Test Environment (`active_env`). ATP→Story / ATR→Story links stay as administrative traceability; do NOT link TCs directly to the Story (last-resort only, for instances with no Test Set work type — see Gotcha #9). Verify with `[TMS_TOOL] trace`.
- Stage 2: Smoke test -> UI / API / DB exploration **beyond the planned outlines** -> update outline status (native) or Test runs in the Test Execution (xray) PASSED / FAILED -> fold any newly-discovered partition/boundary/transition back into the outline set; an exploratory probe becomes a `Test` only if it found a defect or is worth repeating -> file bugs if any.
- Stage 3: Author ATR Test Report -> apply the modality branch (reporting-templates.md §2.3-2.4): Modality jira-native -> write the `{{jira.acceptance_test_results}}` field (or `## Acceptance Test Results (ATR)` fallback comment) then `jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` -> `acceptance-test-results.md` in the STORY folder; Modality jira-xray -> update the Test Execution then `jira:sync-issues get <ATR_KEY>` -> `.context/PBI/test-executions/ATR-<ATR_KEY>-<slug>.md` (acronym prefix = conforming ladder title; a non-conforming title keeps the legacy `TESTPLAN-` / `TESTEXEC-` / `RETESTEXEC-` prefix) -> QA comment via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` -> transition ticket.
- **Per-stage progress checkpoint**: after each Stage subagent returns, the orchestrator appends a phase entry to `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/progress.md` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §7 (`status: completed`, `dispatched_as: Sequential`, `next: Stage <N+1> | hand-off`).
- **Archive after Stage 3**: when Stage 3 completes (or veto-skip Code-Review variant finishes), the orchestrator moves `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/` to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-sprint-testing-<scope>/` and calls `mem_session_summary` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §8. PBI artifacts under `.context/PBI/` stay.
- Afterwards: hand off to `test-documentation` for ROI + Stage 4.

### single-issue, Bug (Triage -> Verify -> Report)

Run the same 4 dispatches; the Stage 1 briefing additionally applies the veto + risk-score decision tree before producing the ATP.

- Triage: veto table (see Gotchas) -> if SKIP, run Code-Review workflow and finish (Stage 2 + Stage 3 dispatches collapse to the in-place comment + transition; the orchestrator skips them only if the Stage 1 subagent reports `veto_outcome: skip`).
- Risk score only if no veto applies. 0-3 LOW, 4-7 MEDIUM (ask user), 8+ HIGH.
- Create ATP + ATR (the ATR is the retest Execution `ReTest: {BUG_KEY}: {summary}`, ALWAYS created with the Test Environment from `active_env` — no ATR without environment). Fill Bug Analysis inside the ATP.
- **Repro Test (Modality jira-xray only)**: create ONE repro `Test` by default, at fix-verification time (Stage 2) — 1:N only if the bug's scope genuinely covers distinct conditions (justify per `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`). Link **Bug↔Test** via the `test` slug (`{{jira.link_types.test}}`, Bug `is tested by` Test — bugs are coverable), execute it in the retest Execution and record PASSED/FAILED. **Modality jira-native**: unchanged — no TCs in-sprint (the bug is the immediate retest case); persistent-Test decisions defer to Stage 4.
- **Regression follow-up**: if the bug is regression-worthy, Stage 4 (`test-documentation` bug-driven decision) ensures a persistent Test covers it — reuse the existing failed Test (or the in-sprint repro Test) or create one (golden rule). Not every bug qualifies; a one-time typo in a stable area is treated like a failed test.
- Execute: reproduce original bug -> verify fix -> regression pass on adjacent areas -> DB cross-validation if data-integrity bug.
- Report: update ATR, post comment (Template C PASSED or Template D FAILED), provide 1-2 evidence screenshot paths to the user.

### sprint-wide

- Pre-step: build the sprint session pair if it does not exist — `plan.md` (the local STP: JQL-resolved queue, waves, assignment) + an empty `progress.md` — and find-or-create the STP issue from it (see `sprint-orchestration.md` §Part 1).
- Loop: read the `plan.md` queue for the first `PENDING` row, dispatch the same 4-stage sequence per issue, then append one entry to the sprint `progress.md` + one comment to the STP + present a per-issue summary + wait for user OK.
- **Interrupted session resume**: Phase 0 runs at both altitudes — once on `sprint-<N>/progress.md` at sprint entry (answers "how far did this sprint get?"), then per issue on `sprint-<N>/<ISSUE>/progress.md` (canonical resume signal per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §4). Domain state for an in-flight issue sits beside the latter in `sprint-<N>/<ISSUE>/test-session-memory.md` (load-bearing for the 4 sub-agent dispatches). The files serve different concerns: `progress.md` decides "which stage is next?"; `test-session-memory.md` carries the per-issue payload that each sub-agent reads. All survive a `jira:sync-issues` re-pull because none lives in the PBI cache.
- After each stage subagent returns, the orchestrator appends a phase entry to the ISSUE's `progress.md` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §7. After Stage 3 completes, the orchestrator (a) appends ONE entry to the SPRINT's `progress.md` and mirrors it as one STP comment, then (b) runs Archive on the issue sub-scope: moves `.session/sprint-testing/sprint-<N>/<ISSUE>/` to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-sprint-testing-sprint-<N>-<ISSUE>/` and calls `mem_session_summary`. The PBI artifacts under `.context/PBI/` stay. The sprint pair is archived only at sprint close (§STEP 7), never while an issue is mid-flight.
- **Nothing local is a deliverable.** `.session/` is gitignored and exists only on this machine. The sprint's shareable record is the STP in Jira (description ← `plan.md`, comments ← `progress.md`) and the per-Story ATP / ATS / ATR items. Never tell the user a local file is the canonical output.
- Stop on TOOL FAILURE. Pause on BUG_FOUND. Append the sprint `progress.md` entry ONLY after Stage 3 completes.

## Gotchas — inline rules you must apply every invocation

1. **Credentials**: always from `.env`. Never hardcode. Never guess passwords.
2. **PBI folder naming**: canonical layout is `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/` (module = Epic, 1:1). `<slug>` is max 5 words, kebab-case, AI-generated from the ticket title. Epic-level files live in the EPIC folder; story-level files in the STORY folder.
3. **Bug TCs are modality-aware**. Modality jira-xray: ONE repro `Test` by default, created at fix-verification time (1:N only when the bug's scope genuinely covers distinct conditions — justify per `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`), linked Bug↔Test via the `test` slug, executed in the retest Execution with PASSED/FAILED recorded. Modality jira-native: ATP + ATR, no TCs in-sprint — the bug ticket is the implicit *immediate* test case; reproduction steps = test steps (defers to Stage 4). Either way a regression-worthy bug MUST end with a persistent Test in Stage 4 — reuse the existing failed Test (or the in-sprint repro Test) or create one (golden rule). Not every bug qualifies.
4. **Smoke test is mandatory** as the first action in Stage 2. If smoke fails (No-Go), stop and report — do not proceed to deep exploration. Smoke failure is an env-level blocker and always stops; deep-exploration findings follow the graduated rule in #10 (a FAIL mid-pass is not auto-Critical).
5. **Bug veto table — SKIP retesting** when the bug is pure text / CSS / docs / config / tech-debt cleanup with no functional change. **REQUIRE retesting** regardless of score when it touches money, data integrity, auth, external integrations, state machines, or calculations. Veto beats risk score.
6. **TCs are created in Stage 1, NEVER in Stage 2**. Stage 2 executes what Planning produced; new TCs found during exploration are added via `[TMS_TOOL] tc create` but the rule is "planning first".
7. **Explain the story -> WAIT for OK**. Never auto-proceed past Session Start without user confirmation. Same for bug triage — present the decision and wait.
8. **Evidence directory**: always configure `.playwright/cli.config.json` `outputDir` to `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/evidence/` BEFORE using `[AUTOMATION_TOOL]`. Screenshots need the full path in `--filename` because `outputDir` does not apply to `.png`.
9. **Traceability check after Stage 1** (Modality jira-xray): run `[TMS_TOOL] trace {TICKET}` and verify the Set-first model — the **coverage backbone is the ATS**: `ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}` linked to the Story via the `test` slug ("is tested by") and holding ALL the Story's TCs (Xray-internal membership, never issue links in this modality). **Story↔ATP and Story↔ATR** links exist as administrative traceability — they contribute ZERO coverage (live-verified). The ATP's and the ATR's test lists are DERIVED from the ATS membership. **Individual TCs are NOT linked directly to the Story** (last-resort only, for instances with no Test Set work type). So verify: Story↔ATS (`test` slug) + ATS membership complete + Story↔ATP, Story↔ATR (administrative) + Plan/Exec lists matching the ATS. Full doctrine: `agentic-qa-core/references/traceability-linking.md` + `test-documentation/references/tms-architecture.md`. Bugs: the repro Test links Bug↔Test via the `test` slug at fix-verification time; before that, traceability "gaps" for missing TCs are expected and OK.
10. **Graduated stop/pause protocol**: TOOL FAILURE -> stop, report, await user. **Blocking** BUG_FOUND (smoke/env down, data integrity, security-exploitable) -> pause, present bug, await decision; NEVER dispatch the next sub-agent while unresolved. **Non-blocking** finding (cosmetic, minor validation, edge-case on a non-critical TC, framework-default pending recalibration) -> the Execution subagent logs it and CONTINUES the pass; the orchestrator surfaces it at Stage 2 close. A FAIL is not auto-Critical — triage first (severity per `references/reporting-templates.md` §1.4; security/auth/framework-default recalibrated at §5.0). See `references/exploration-patterns.md` "Finding triage".
11. **Sprint log timing (sprint-wide)**: append the sprint-altitude `progress.md` entry — and its mirror STP comment — only AFTER Stage 3 completes and the orchestrator-side checklist verifies. Not earlier. `progress.md` is append-only in both directions: never rewrite an entry, never edit a posted comment; a correction is a NEW entry and a NEW comment. There is no local sprint tracker file to update — that artifact is retired.
12. **Language**: all artifacts, TMS content, and commit messages in English. Mirror the user's language only in conversation.
13. **Environment + inbox preflight before ATP**: Session Start §0.6 probes `{{WEB_URL}}` / `{{API_URL}}` for reachability (and, for email/auth-dependent stories, that the inbox can *receive*) BEFORE any ATP/Jira write. A dead env or send-only inbox is caught here with a STOP, not at Stage 2 after the ATP is already authored. Reachability gate ≠ Stage 2 smoke — see S7.
14. **Severity recalibration before blocking a Story**: a Story TC FAIL is NOT automatically a blocking defect. When the failing TC is security/auth/framework-default class (cookie flags, CSP/HSTS headers, SDK-by-design behavior), run the recalibration gate (`references/reporting-templates.md` §5.0) BEFORE firing `{{jira.transition.story.defect_reported}}`/blocked: state the framework-default/mitigation hypothesis, cite one verification fact, surface to the user. A recalibrated finding becomes GO-with-debt (`PASSED WITH ISSUES`), not a blocker. Mechanical path stays the default for ordinary functional FAILs. **Once the gate confirms a real blocking defect and the `defect_reported` → `blocked` transition fires, also create the Story `is blocked by` Bug issuelink** via `{{jira.link_types.blocks.name}}` (the Bug `blocks` the Story) — methodology step in `references/reporting-templates.md` §5.1, mechanics in `agentic-qa-core/references/traceability-linking.md` (§2/§4/§6). The status transition alone does not record the dependency edge.
15. **Session env override**: to test against an ad-hoc URL not in `.agents/project.yaml` (broken staging, ephemeral preview deploy, hotfix branch URL), record it ONCE in `test-session-memory.md` §Environment as `WEB_URL_OVERRIDE` / `API_URL_OVERRIDE`. When set, it beats the `project.yaml` active-env value for every stage and is read automatically by all four dispatches — never re-thread it per briefing, and never write it to `project.yaml` (session-only). Distinct from `active_env` switching, which picks a *named* env from `project.yaml`.
16. **Session-footer contract (mandatory at close)**: the final stage is not done until the two chat-facing blocks from `../agentic-qa-core/references/session-footer-contract.md` are printed: (1) consolidated screenshot list — repo-relative paths, verified on disk, bug annotations first — plus in-flow surfacing of every capture's path the instant it lands; (2) Session Footer listing skills/MCPs/CLIs actually used + testing levels touched, with explicit "none" entries for expected-but-untouched levels. Framing for this skill: execution. Multi-subagent sessions: each stage report carries the five footer fields (`skills_loaded`, `mcps_used`, `clis_used`, `testing_levels_touched`, `screenshots_captured`); the orchestrator compiles the footer ONCE at close. Chat only — never in a Jira comment or ATR body.

## Cross-skill handoff — what this skill does NOT do

| Predecessor | Load this skill | Reason |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Pre-sprint AC refinement on a batch of backlog Stories | `shift-left-testing` | Stage 0. If the Story passed through `/shift-left-testing` and carries label `shift-left-reviewed` with a dated label <30 days old, Stage 1 here short-circuits Phases 1-3 of `acceptance-test-planning.md` and continues from Phase 4. The shift-left pass leaves the ATP in the `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` FIELD only (field-first — no Test Plan item pre-sprint); Stage 1 finds-or-creates the item FROM that field. The short-circuit reads the SYNCED `acceptance-test-plan.md`. If the Story did NOT pass through Shift-Left, Stage 1 runs all phases in full — but this is more expensive in-sprint than pre-sprint. |

| After Stage 3 you need... | Load this skill | Reason |
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Formalize TCs in Jira/Xray, calculate ROI, decide Candidate / Manual / Deferred | `test-documentation` | Stage 4. This skill produces the inputs (outlines + execution evidence); `test-documentation` produces the formal regression backlog — creating `Test` work items (jira-native) or creating/promoting them into the Regression Test Plan (jira-xray), regression-worthy scenarios only. |
| Write the automated test code (KATA Page / Api + test file) | `test-automation` | Stage 5. Plan -> Code -> Review pipeline. |
| Run the regression or smoke suite in CI and emit a GO/NO-GO verdict | `regression-testing` | Stage 6. This skill's Stage 2 smoke is local-manual, not the CI suite. |
| Generate `business-data-map.md`, `business-feature-map.md`, `business-api-map.md`, `master-test-plan.md` | `project-discovery` (or the individual `/business-*-map` and `/master-test-plan` commands) | Sprint-testing consumes these; it does not create them. |

If Session Start reports that any of the project-wide context files are missing, stop and hand off to `project-discovery` (or the relevant command). Do not continue without them.

## Pseudocode tags used here

| Tag | Resolves to | Defined in |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| `[TMS_TOOL]` | xray-cli skill, Atlassian MCP, or `{{TMS_CLI}}` | `AGENTS.md` Tool Resolution |
| `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` | `acli`, Atlassian MCP, or `{{ISSUE_TRACKER_CLI}}` | `AGENTS.md` Tool Resolution |

> **Reads vs writes split** (per `agentic-qa-core/references/acli-integration.md` §"Reads vs writes"): **detailed reads** of an issue (custom fields, ACs, ATP/ATR, description, comments) use `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` (or `jql "<query>"`) then read the synced `.md` — NEVER `acli workitem view` (returns `null` for custom fields). **Writes / transitions / links / bug creation / trivial summary-or-status lookups** stay on `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` (`/acli`). **Traceability** (link graph Story↔ATP↔ATR↔TC, Xray run status) stays on `[TMS_TOOL]` / `/acli` / `/xray-cli` — do NOT migrate trace reads to the sync.
| `[AUTOMATION_TOOL]` | playwright-cli skill or Playwright MCP | `AGENTS.md` Tool Resolution |
| `[DB_TOOL]` | DBHub MCP or Supabase MCP | `AGENTS.md` Tool Resolution |
| `[API_TOOL]` | Schema read → OpenAPI MCP (read-only); execute → curl (token via `bun run api:login`) | `AGENTS.md` Tool Resolution + `agentic-qa-core/references/api-testing-doctrine.md` |

Concrete tools (`bun`, `git`, `gh`) are used literally. Project variables like `{{PROJECT_KEY}}`, `{{DB_MCP}}`, `{{WEB_URL}}` are resolved from `.agents/project.yaml` (env-scoped vars resolve to the active environment).

## Anti-patterns — NEVER do these

- **S1.** NEVER mark a Story Ready For Release (or transition to {{jira.status.story.qa_approved}}) without QA sign-off AND a signed-off ATR snapshot for audit trail.
- **S2.** NEVER skip the Stage 1 Test Plan (ATP) step in Modality jira-xray workflows — the Xray `Test Plan` / `Test Execution` issues depend on the ATP being committed first; downstream TCs cannot link without it.
- **S3.** NEVER push test results to Jira without an ATR snapshot. The QA comment is a summary; the ATR is the audit record.
- **S4.** NEVER duplicate the ATR across Jira + Confluence (or any second store). Single source of truth — pick one per the modality decision in `.context/master-test-plan.md` and link from anywhere else.
- **S5.** NEVER bypass the bug-triage decision tree (veto → risk-score → Severity + Root Cause) when a test fails. Every failure gets a triage before it becomes a Bug ticket.
- **S6.** NEVER write ATP / ATR bodies in raw ADF JSON by hand. Use md-to-adf via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` so formatting survives Jira's renderer.
- **S7.** NEVER skip the smoke pass before triforce (UI / API / DB) exploration. Smoke validates the environment; triforce validates the feature. Order matters — a broken env produces false-positive bug reports.
- **S8.** NEVER mix UI + API + DB findings into a single bug ticket. File per layer (or per root-cause cluster) so triage and routing stay clean.
- **S9.** NEVER reuse a PBI folder across tickets. Every Story or Bug gets its own `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/` directory; cross-ticket contamination breaks evidence + traceability.
- **S10.** NEVER transition the ticket Ready For QA → In Test without explaining the story to the user AND waiting for confirmation (AGENTS.md §8 — Session Start is not a one-shot, it's a hand-off gate).
- **S11.** NEVER skip the auto-stage promote (Session Start → Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3) after a phase completes — each promote is a checkpoint that writes a `progress.md` entry and feeds the next subagent's Context docs.
- **S12.** NEVER file a bug without a reproducible repro path AND evidence (screenshot, trace, log, network HAR, or DB row reference). "It failed for me once" is not a bug ticket.
- **S13.** NEVER hardcode `customfield_NNNNN` IDs in ATP / ATR / QA comments or in any reference under this skill. Resolve every Jira field via `{{jira.<slug>}}` against `.agents/jira-required.yaml`.
- **S14.** NEVER hand-write a Jira-mirrored `.md` in the PBI folder (`story.md`, `acceptance-criteria.md`, `acceptance-test-plan.md`, `acceptance-test-results.md`, `comments.md`, `feature-test-plan.md`, `module-context.md`, `test-cases/`, etc.). To SET their content: author it → write to the Jira custom field via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` (or, when the field is absent, a structured comment per `.agents/jira-required.yaml` `fallback:`; `module-context.md` goes to the `## Module Context (QA)` section of the Epic description) → run `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` → READ the materialized file. The whole PBI tree is gitignored, so a hand-written file there is invisible to every other machine. Only `context.md` and `evidence/` are hand-authored inside PBI (local-only by design); `test-session-memory.md` is hand-authored under `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/`.
- **S15.** NEVER bury a hard-to-reverse test-architecture decision in a ticket plan. If Stage 1 planning forces a decision that is architectural AND hard to reverse (test-data-isolation contract, auth-in-tests change, fixture topology, flake-retry policy spanning 3+ tests or 2+ tickets), promote it to `.context/ADR/ADR-NNNN-<slug>.md` (append-only; supersede, never edit) and leave a `See ADR-NNNN` backlink in the plan's `## Technical Decisions`. Ticket-local trade-offs stay in the plan. AI drafts `Proposed`; the human approves. See `agentic-qa-core/references/adr-doctrine.md` §1–§2.
- **S16.** NEVER create an ATR / retest Execution without a Test Environment. The environment resolves from `active_env` in `.agents/project.yaml` (or the session env switch) and is set at creation time. An environment-less Execution fails the Stage-1 DoD gate (`agentic-qa-core/references/stage-gates.md`) — no ATR without environment.
- **S17.** NEVER maintain the ATS's, the ATP's, and the ATR's test lists as independent id lists (Modality jira-xray). The ATS membership is the single source; the Plan and the Execution DERIVE their lists from it. Three hand-maintained lists drift silently and corrupt coverage.

## Pre-flight checklist

- [ ] Phase 0 — Session resume check ran (read `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/progress.md`); user chose resume / restart / abort if prior state existed
- [ ] Mode ASKED and answered (`sprint-wide` / `single-issue`) — never inferred from the invocation wording
- [ ] Sprint-wide: `.session/sprint-testing/sprint-<N>/plan.md` written with the JQL-resolved queue; skipped work types noted, not treated as blockers
- [ ] Session Start complete, user confirmed the story explanation
- [ ] `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/plan.md` written (per `session-management.md` §6 schema)
- [ ] Project-wide context files present (if missing, hand off to `project-discovery`)
- [ ] PBI folder + `context.md` created · session dir + `test-session-memory.md` created
- [ ] `.env` credentials loaded (no hardcoded passwords)
- [ ] Bug path: veto table evaluated BEFORE risk score
- [ ] Sprint STP found-or-created (first ticket) / updated (Session Start §0.7; skip note if the work type is absent)
- [ ] Stage 1 artifacts created with full traceability, verified via `[TMS_TOOL] trace` — jira-xray: Set-first order honored (ATP item from the field · ATS with ALL TCs linked to the Story via the `test` slug · Plan/Exec lists derived from the ATS membership)
- [ ] ATR / retest Execution carries the Test Environment (`active_env`) — no environment, no ATR (S16)
- [ ] Stage 2 smoke test executed FIRST, Go/No-Go recorded
- [ ] Evidence captured under the ticket's `evidence/` folder
- [ ] Stage 3 ATR filled + QA comment posted + ticket transitioned
- [ ] Per-stage progress checkpoint appended to `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/progress.md` after each Stage subagent returned
- [ ] Archive: `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/` moved to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-sprint-testing-<scope>/` and `mem_session_summary` called after Stage 3
- [ ] Hand-off identified for Stages 4 / 5 / 6 if applicable
- [ ] Sprint-wide: sprint `progress.md` entry appended + mirrored as ONE STP comment AFTER Stage 3 only, user OK'd the next issue
- [ ] Session footer + consolidated screenshot list printed in chat per session-footer-contract (never in a Jira comment)
