# TMS Architecture — Entity Model and Traceability

Definitive reference for the four TMS entities, their fields, their links, and the order in which to create them. Read this when creating any artifact, validating traceability, or fixing broken links.

> **Before publishing any TMS entity body (Test / TestPlan / TestExecution / TestRun) to Jira rich-text fields**, read `../../agentic-qa-core/references/jira-publishing-gotchas.md` — covers the two ADF conversion gotchas (`md-to-adf` mark collision + MCP batched custom-field rejection) that silently fail HTTP 400.

---

## 1. The five entities

Every QA-tested user story produces five artifact types. The model is tool-agnostic: the same structure applies in Jira+Xray, native Jira, Coda, Azure DevOps, and TestRail. Only the implementing issue types differ.

| Entity | Full name | Purpose | When created | Where the content lives |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **US** | User Story / Backlog item | The requirement under test | Pre-QA | Description + ACs |
| **ATP** | Acceptance Test Plan | Approach, risk analysis, AC-to-TC coverage. Contains the Test Analysis. | Content pre-sprint in the Story field `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` (shift-left); the Test Plan ITEM by `/sprint-testing` Stage 1 from that field (find-or-create in Stage 4 only when module-driven and no item exists) | ATP issue body |
| **ATR** | Acceptance Test Results | Execution results, findings, evidence. Contains the Test Report. | Stage 1 (created early), filled Stage 3 | ATR issue body |
| **ATS** | Acceptance Test Set | Per-Story Test Set holding ALL the Story's TCs (even one). **Coverage anchor**: the ATS→Story `is tested by` link is what fills the Xray coverage panel. Mandatory per Story. | Stage 1 / Stage 4 (find-or-create, Set-first) | ATS issue (membership + link graph) |
| **TC** | Test Case | Individual test: precondition + action + expected. Lives in a test repository. | Stage 4 (Documentation) | TC issue body |

### Container per modality (load-bearing)

The entity model is tool-agnostic, but the **container** each entity lives in changes with the TMS modality. Resolve modality via `test-documentation/SKILL.md` §Phase 0 before using these mappings.

> **Items over fields (by excellence).** Every Plan is a **Test Plan** issue and every Run is a
> **Test Execution** issue — in BOTH modalities. These are native Jira work types (Xray-independent),
> so the standard does NOT branch on modality for *structure*; Xray only adds the run/coverage engine.
> The Story custom field for ATP/ATR is a **degraded fallback ONLY**, used when the Test Plan /
> Test Execution work types are unavailable in the instance. The column below labelled "field
> fallback" is that degraded mode, not the default.

| Entity | Items first (both modalities) | Degraded fallback (work type unavailable) |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **US** | Jira `Story` | — |
| **ATP** | A native Jira `Test Plan` issue, titled `ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}`. Parented to **QA Master Test Plan**, linked to the Story via "tests". Real, queryable, JQL-filterable. Under Xray it is also the coverage anchor. | Story's `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field; else a `## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)` comment. **No separate issue** — used only when the work type is absent. |
| **ATR** | A native Jira `Test Execution` issue, titled `ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing`. Parented to **QA Test Artifacts**. Under Xray it holds `Test Runs` per TC, plus Environment, Begin/End Date, and is the target of `[TMS_TOOL] Import Results` at the end of every CI run. | Story's `{{jira.acceptance_test_results}}` field; else a `## Acceptance Test Results (ATR)` comment. **No separate issue.** CI updates the Test Status field on each TC directly. |
| **TC** | Xray `Test` issue (type Manual / Cucumber / Generic), or a Jira-native `Test` custom issue type (set up per `references/jira-setup.md`) / `Task` with a `Test Type` custom field. Parented to **QA Test Repository**. | — |
| **ATS** | A `Test Set` issue titled `ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}`, **mandatory per Story**, parented to **QA Test Artifacts**, `components` inherited from the Story (**mandatory**), linked to the Story via `is tested by` (the coverage-panel link). Membership: Xray-internal under jira-xray; **TC→ATS issue links** under jira-native (carve-out — the "membership is never a link" rule is xray-only). | Work type absent → **no ATS**: direct TC→Story `is tested by` links (the cascade's last resort). |
| **TS (feature Test Set) / Precondition** | Native Jira work types, parented to **QA Test Artifacts** (first-class under Xray; selectable plain Jira issue types otherwise). The feature-level `TS:` is an **OPTIONAL** grouping (smoke / regression); `components` is OPTIONAL on the feature-level `TS:` **only** — the per-Story ATS inherits the Story's components (mandatory). | Group by labels + the QA Test Repository / QA Test Artifacts Epic when the work type is absent. |

Key consequences:

- **By excellence the Test Plan and Test Execution issues exist in both modalities** — they are real, queryable, filterable by JQL, carry real issue-links (Plan→scope, Run→Plan, Run→TC) and an independent status lifecycle. The Test Execution is the target of `[TMS_TOOL] Import Results` at the end of every CI run.
- **Only in the degraded fallback** (the work type is unavailable in the instance) does ATP/ATR content live on the Story custom field. There, traceability from a TC back to the plan/results walks via the "is tested by" link to the Story, then reads the Story's custom fields.
- The title grammar (`ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}` / `ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing`) is identical in both modalities — in the fallback it identifies the section header in the Story comment, not an issue key.

|-------|----------|-------|
| ID | Yes | `{{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}` auto-assigned |

|   Coverage truth (live-verified): the ATS->Story `is tested by` link |
|   is what fills the Xray coverage panel; the ATP->Story and          |
|   ATR->Story links contribute ZERO coverage (administrative          |
|   traceability only). TCs aggregate to the Story through the ATS.    |
|   Resolution cascade: TC -> ATS -> Story (primary) ->                |
|   TC -> ATP -> Story (secondary, placement-only) ->                  |
|   TC -> Story direct (last resort) -> else ORPHAN.                   |
|   Edges render bidirectionally:                                      |
|     US <-> ATS <-> TC   (membership; coverage backbone)              |
|     US <-> ATP <-> TC   (designs / is designed by)                   |
|     US <-> ATR <-> TC   (executes / is executed by)                  |
|     ATP <-> ATR         (plan / results)                             |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Cardinality

| From | To | Cardinality | Link direction |
|------|----|-------------|----------------|
| US | ATS | 1:1 | `is tested by` (`test`) — **the coverage-panel link** |
| US | ATP | 1:1 | `is tested by` (`test`) — administrative, no coverage |
| US | ATR | 1:1 | `is tested by` (`test`) — administrative, no coverage |
| US | TC | 1:N | **via the ATS by default** (membership + ATS→Story link); direct `is tested by` only as the cascade's last resort (no ATS) |
| ATS | TC | 1:N | Membership — Xray-internal (jira-xray) or TC→ATS issue link (jira-native) |
| ATP | ATR | 1:1 | Bidirectional (plan / results) |
| ATP | TC | 1:N | ATP `designs` TC / TC `is designed by` ATP (`test_design`) |
| ATR | TC | 1:N | ATR `executes` TC / TC `is executed by` ATR (`test_execute`) |
| TC | AC | N:1 (or N:M) | TC covers one or more ACs |

Given any one of the five, you must be able to navigate to the other four. That is what "traceability" means. The US↔TC navigation resolves by the **cascade**: `TC → ATS → Story` (primary — fills coverage) → `TC → ATP → Story` (secondary, placement-only: does NOT fill the coverage panel) → `TC → Story` direct (last resort — valid, but only when no ATS exists) → else ORPHAN. Linking every TC to the Story directly is avoided by default because it floods the Story panel with noise; the ATS is the aggregation point. The direct link is NOT a defect — the defect is a TC with NO path to its Story.

---

## 4. Traceability rules

### Mandatory links

| Entity | Required link | Type / direction | When to set |
|--------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| **ATS** | User Story | `is tested by` (`test`) — **the coverage-panel link** | At creation (Set-first: before the first TC) |
| **ATS** | each TC | Membership — Xray-internal (jira-xray) / TC→ATS issue link (jira-native) | At TC creation |
| **ATP** | User Story | `is tested by` (`test`) — administrative, no coverage | At creation |
| **ATP** | Test Results (ATR) | Bidirectional (plan / results) | After ATR is created |
| **ATP** | each TC | ATP `designs` TC (`test_design`) | At TC creation |
| **ATR** | User Story | `is tested by` (`test`) — administrative, no coverage | At creation |
| **ATR** | each TC | ATR `executes` TC (`test_execute`) | At TC creation |
| **TC** | ATS | Membership (see ATS row) | At creation |
| **TC** | Test Plan (ATP) | `is designed by` ATP (`test_design`) | At creation |
| **TC** | Test Result (ATR) | `is executed by` ATR (`test_execute`) | At creation |
| **TC** | Acceptance Criterion | AC reference | At creation |

**Coverage truth (live-verified 2026-08-21, `.session/artifact-ladder-refactor/scoping.md` §Verificación)**: the Xray coverage panel is filled ONLY by an `is tested by` link from a Test Set (the ATS) or a direct Test↔Story link — the ATP→Story and ATR→Story links contribute ZERO coverage. That is why the ATS is mandatory: it is the coverage backbone, while ATP/ATR links are administrative traceability.

A TC is **NOT** linked to the User Story directly while an ATS exists — it reaches the Story through the ATS (membership + the ATS→Story link). The direct TC→Story link is the cascade's **last resort** (no ATS available — e.g. jira-native without the Test Set work type), not a defect; the defect is a TC with **no path at all**. A TC missing its ATS membership or its ATP/ATR links is broken — use `fix-traceability` to repair. **Under jira-xray, the Xray-internal attach (`plan add-tests` / `exec add-tests` / `set add-tests`) creates NO Jira links** — the `designs`/`executes` Jira edges MUST be created explicitly via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` (`/acli`). Jira-native carve-out: with a Test Set work type present, ATS membership IS expressed as TC→ATS issue links. (Slug-layer mechanics live in `agentic-qa-core/references/traceability-linking.md` §3/§9.)

### Validation checklist (before marking Complete)

- [ ] ATS exists, links to the User Story (`is tested by` — coverage panel shows Covered), and holds ALL the Story's TCs
- [ ] ATP links to User Story (`is tested by`) AND ATR
- [ ] ATR links to User Story (`is tested by`)
- [ ] Every TC is a member of the ATS and links to ATP (`is designed by`) and ATR (`is executed by`)
- [ ] No direct Story↔TC links exist while the ATS covers them (direct links are valid ONLY as the cascade's last resort, when no ATS exists)
- [ ] ATP Test Coverage maps all ACs to TCs
- [ ] ATR Test Coverage reflects execution results
- [ ] User Story panel shows references to ATS, ATP and ATR (TCs reachable one hop further, through the ATS)

---

## 5. Creation and linking order

Artifacts must be created in a specific sequence. Creating TCs first, ATP second leaves orphaned references that are painful to repair.

### The sequence (Set-first)

```
Step 1. Find-or-create the Story's ATS (mandatory — even for one TC)
        -> link ATS to User Story (Story `is tested by` ATS, `test`) — THE coverage-panel link

Step 2. Find-or-create ATP
        (pre-sprint the ATP content lives in {{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}, written by
        shift-left; the ITEM is normally created by /sprint-testing Stage 1 from that
        field — create here only when module-driven and no Story ATP item exists)
        -> link ATP to User Story (Story `is tested by` ATP, `test`) — administrative
        (ATR link left empty for now)

Step 3. Create ATR
        -> link ATR to User Story (Story `is tested by` ATR, `test`) — administrative

Step 4. Update ATP
        -> link ATP to ATR (bidirectional plan/results)

Step 5. For each TC (as Stage 4 progresses):
        Create TC
        -> add TC to the ATS (jira-xray: Xray-internal membership; jira-native: TC→ATS issue link)
        -> link TC to ATP (ATP `designs` TC / TC `is designed by` ATP, `test_design`)
        -> link TC to ATR (ATR `executes` TC / TC `is executed by` ATR, `test_execute`)
        -> link TC to AC
        # Do NOT link TC to the User Story directly while the ATS exists — it aggregates
        # via the ATS. Direct TC→Story is the cascade's last resort (no ATS available).

Step 6. Derive the ATP's and the ATR's test lists FROM the ATS membership
        (the ATS holds ALL the Story's TCs; Plan and Execution consume that list).
```

### Why this order

1. **ATS first**: the coverage backbone must exist before any TC — its membership is the source the ATP and ATR test lists derive from, and its Story link is the only one the coverage panel counts.
2. **ATP second**: the plan must exist before execution results can reference it. Its content usually pre-exists (field-first from shift-left, item from sprint-testing Stage 1); find-or-create.
3. **ATR third**: created early so the ATP can reference it. Test Report content is filled after execution.
4. **ATP <-> ATR fourth**: once both exist, wire up the bidirectional link.
5. **TCs last**: by the time a TC is created, the ATS, ATP and ATR exist, so the membership, `designs` (ATP) and `executes` (ATR) edges are set at creation. The TC is bound to the Story's graph through the ATS — a direct Story↔TC link only when no ATS exists.

### Pseudocode — full sequence

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/xray-cli` skill (Modality jira-xray) — in Modality jira-native these `[TMS_TOOL]` calls fall through to `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`, so load `/acli` instead. See §9 for the per-modality split.

```
[TMS_TOOL] Create ATS:                      # find-or-create — Set-first, MANDATORY per Story
  name: ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}
  story: {from User Story title}            # Story `is tested by` ATS (test) — THE coverage-panel link
  components: {inherited from the source Story}   # mandatory (exemption is feature-level TS: only)
  # Parent Epic: QA Test Artifacts

[TMS_TOOL] Create ATP:                      # find-or-create — item usually exists from /sprint-testing
  name: ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}     # Stage 1 (pre-sprint content: {{jira.acceptance_test_plan}})
  story: {from User Story title}            # Story `is tested by` ATP (test) — administrative, no coverage
  components: {inherited from the source Story}   # mandatory
  # Parent Epic: QA Master Test Plan

[TMS_TOOL] Create ATR:
  name: ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing
  story: {from User Story title}            # Story `is tested by` ATR (test) — administrative, no coverage
  components: {inherited from the source Story}   # mandatory
  # Parent Epic: QA Test Artifacts

[TMS_TOOL] Update ATP:
  id: {from ATP created above}
  results: {from ATR name created above}    # ATP <-> ATR (plan / results)

[TMS_TOOL] Create TC:
  name: {per TC naming convention}
  test-set: {from ATS name}                 # membership — ALL the Story's TCs live in the ATS
  test-plan: {from ATP name}                # ATP `designs` TC (test_design)
  test-result: {from ATR name}              # ATR `executes` TC (test_execute)
  ac: {from the Acceptance Criterion this TC covers}
  components: [{module}]                    # mandatory — affected product module
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  # NO `story:` link while the ATS exists — the TC aggregates to the Story through
  # the ATS (coverage) plus the ATP (`designs`) and ATR (`executes`). Direct TC→Story
  # is the cascade's last resort (no ATS available).
  # The Xray-internal attach creates NO Jira links — the designs/executes edges
  # are created explicitly via [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] (/acli). Slug layering:
  # traceability-linking.md §3/§9.

# Set-first closure: derive the ATP's and ATR's test lists FROM the ATS membership.
```

---

## 6. Naming conventions (canonical)

| Entity | Pattern | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| User Story | `{{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}` | `PROJ-123` |
| ATP | `ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}` | `ATP: PROJ-123: Apply discount at checkout` |
| ATR | `ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing` | `ATR: PROJ-123: Story Testing` |
| ATS | `ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}` | `ATS: PROJ-123: Apply discount at checkout` |
| TS (optional, feature-level) | `TS: {EPIC-KEY\|module}: Validate {feature}` | `TS: PROJ-42: Validate checkout` |
| TC (TMS title) | `{US_ID}: TC#: should <expected outcome> [<connector> <condition>] [given <precondition>]` | `PROJ-101: TC1: should grant access when credentials are valid` |
| TC (code / ATC) | `{US_ID}: should <behavior> when <condition>` | `PROJ-101: should display error when password is incorrect` |

Rules:

1. ATP, ATR and ATS names always include the User Story ID. This makes them searchable, unique per story, and impossible to confuse across stories. The feature-level `TS:` is the only Set that scopes to an Epic/module instead.
2. TC names follow the pattern `{US_ID}: TC#: should <expected outcome> [<connector> <condition>] [given <precondition>]`, where `CORE` is the expected outcome (verb + object phrased after `should`, e.g., `grant access`, `reject login`) and `CONDITIONAL` is the optional connector clause (`when …` / `if …`, e.g., `when credentials are valid`, `if password is incorrect`) plus an optional `given …` precondition. The prefix is ALWAYS the User Story ID, in every modality; Test Set membership is never baked into the title. Under Modality jira-xray it is also **not** a Jira issue link — membership is Xray-internal, managed through `/xray-cli`, never `acli link create` (see `.agents/jira-required.yaml` → `link_types`); jira-native carve-out: with a Test Set work type present, membership IS expressed as TC→ATS issue links. A consequence worth knowing: `bun run jira:sync-issues` talks to the Jira REST API, so under jira-xray it cannot see Test Set membership or Precondition associations at all — only the Xray GraphQL API exposes them.
3. Code-side IDs match the TMS-generated key exactly. The `@atc('PROJ-456')` decorator uses the TMS issue key, not an invented module prefix.
4. Module prefixes (e.g., `AUTH-`, `ORD-`) are a TMS-display convention only (Test Set names, TMS folders) — they are not the canonical ID, and they never appear in file names: the sync materializes each Test as `test-cases/TEST-<KEY>-<slug>.md`.

---

## 7. Completed User Story view

When all In-Sprint Testing stages are complete, the User Story panel in the TMS should look like this:

```
User Story: PROJ-123 — <Story Title>

| Test Set (is tested by)     | ATS: PROJ-123: Apply discount at checkout | Coverage: Covered |
| Test Plan (is tested by)    | ATP: PROJ-123: Apply discount at checkout | Complete |
| Test Results (is tested by) | ATR: PROJ-123: Story Testing              | Complete |
(No direct Test Case links on the Story — TCs are reached through the ATS; the
 ATS→Story link is the one filling the coverage panel.)

ATS (ATS: PROJ-123: Apply discount at checkout)
  User Story:    PROJ-123 (tests / is tested by)  <- coverage-panel link
  Tests:         TC-1, TC-2, TC-3, TC-4           (membership — ALL the Story's TCs)

ATP (ATP: PROJ-123: Apply discount at checkout)
  User Story:    PROJ-123 (tests / is tested by)
  Test Analysis: [filled]
  Designs:       TC-1, TC-2, TC-3, TC-4        (test_design)
  Test Coverage: AC1 -> TC-1; AC2 -> TC-2; AC3 -> TC-3, TC-4
  Test Results:  ATR: PROJ-123: Story Testing
  Complete:      Yes

ATR (ATR: PROJ-123: Story Testing)
  User Story:    PROJ-123 (tests / is tested by)
  Test Report:   [filled]
  Executes:      TC-1, TC-2, TC-3, TC-4        (test_execute)
  Test Coverage: AC1 -> TC-1 PASSED; AC2 -> TC-2 PASSED; AC3 -> TC-3 PASSED, TC-4 FAILED
  Complete:      Yes

Test Cases (each: member of the ATS, is designed by ATP, is executed by ATR — no direct US link needed)
  TC-1 | PASSED | AC1 | should <behavior> when <condition>
  TC-2 | PASSED | AC2 | should <behavior> when <condition>
  TC-3 | PASSED | AC3 | should <behavior> when <condition>
  TC-4 | FAILED | AC3 | should <behavior> when <condition>
```

### Completeness criteria

A User Story is fully documented when:

0. ATS exists, is linked to the Story (`is tested by` — the coverage panel shows Covered), and holds ALL the Story's TCs.
1. ATP exists, is linked, and is marked Complete.
2. ATR exists, is linked, and is marked Complete.
3. Every TC has a Test Status (`PASSED`, `FAILED`, or `NOT RUN`).
4. Every AC has either at least one **documented** TC OR an explicit Deferred note in the prioritization report. The documented TC set is intentionally sparse — only the regression-worthy scenarios (Candidate + Manual) are persisted; the wide 1:N derivation happened upstream (in `/sprint-testing` planning + exploration) and most of it is correctly Deferred (no TMS TC). Do NOT inflate documentation to "N TCs per AC" — that is a design/execution concern, not a documentation one.
5. Where a regression-worthy scenario IS persisted, its TC is technique-shaped: a documented boundary TC uses BVA values, a documented state TC covers the transition, etc. (`agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`). Technique governs the SHAPE of what you document, not how MUCH you document.
6. ATP and ATR are bidirectionally linked, and both are linked to the US via `is tested by` (administrative — coverage comes from the ATS link).
7. Every TC is a member of the ATS and links to the ATP (`is designed by`) and ATR (`is executed by`); no direct US link while the ATS covers it.

Any failing criterion -> the story is not ready to close QA.

## 8. TC workflow state machine

> **Substrate reference — AUTHORITATIVE**: `.agents/jira-workflows.json` (`work_types.test_case`) is the source of truth for every status and transition name in this section; `.agents/jira-required.yaml` declares which are required. A status that is not in that JSON does not exist in the instance — never write one from memory (`Approved`, `Automating`, `Merge Request` and `Triaged` are common inventions and none of them exist). Skills resolve names via `{{jira.status.test_case.<slug>}}` / `{{jira.transition.test_case.<slug>}}`. Rename detection runs via `bun run jira:sync-workflows`.

The TC workflow spans three IQL stages. Key transitions: `start_design` (Draft -> In Design), `ready_to_run` (In Design -> READY), `for_manual` (READY -> MANUAL), `automation_review_from_ready` (READY -> In Review), `approve_to_automate` (In Review -> Candidate), `start_automation` (Candidate -> In Automation), `create_pr` (In Automation -> Pull Request), `merged` (Pull Request -> AUTOMATED). Never skip states; use `back_from_ready` / `back_from_in_design` for rework, `deprecated` (any -> DEPRECATED) to retire a TC, `recover` (DEPRECATED -> Draft) to revive one.

```
Stage 2 (Execution)     Stage 4 (Documentation)     Stage 5 (Automation)
-----------------       -----------------------     ---------------------

Draft -> In Design -> READY -+-- for manual --> MANUAL        (manual regression branch)
                             |
                             +-- automation review --> In Review
                                                         |

                                                                                         +-- start automation --> In Automation
                                                                                                                     |
                                                                                                                     +-- create PR --> Pull Request
                                                                                                                                          |
                                                                                                                                          +-- merged --> AUTOMATED

MANUAL -- automation review --> In Review   |   MANUAL -- for automation --> Candidate   |   MANUAL -- automated --> AUTOMATED
Any state -> DEPRECATED (when feature is removed) -- recover --> Draft
```

Rules:
- No state can be skipped. Draft must go through In Design before READY; READY cannot go straight to AUTOMATED.
- Backward transitions are the `back_*` family (one step back per state) plus "any state to DEPRECATED".
- MANUAL is not a dead end: a MANUAL TC can later re-enter In Review, Candidate, or AUTOMATED if ROI changes.

## 9. Pseudocode — common entity operations

All operations use `[TMS_TOOL]` for TMS-specific actions and `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` for generic issue operations. Resolution via AGENTS.md Tool Resolution (Xray CLI, Jira CLI, or MCP fallback).

### List and read

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/xray-cli` skill (Modality jira-xray). In Modality jira-native, load `/acli` — these calls map to JQL/search via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`.

```
[TMS_TOOL] List ATPs:
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  ticket: {from User Story ID}

[TMS_TOOL] List ATRs:
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  ticket: {from User Story ID}

[TMS_TOOL] List TCs:
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  ticket: {from User Story ID}

[TMS_TOOL] Get TC:
  id: {from TC ID}
```

### Create

Pseudocode splits by TMS modality — pick the block matching the resolution from SKILL.md §Phase 0. Full per-modality reference in SKILL.md §Quick reference.

#### Parallel TC creation (default for N > 10)

When the candidate list has more than 10 TCs, creating them serially burns the orchestrator's context with raw API responses. Shard the list into chunks of ~5-10 TCs per subagent, cap total subagents at 10. The orchestrator pre-creates the ATS / ATP / ATR (Phase 3 §Linking order — Set-first, steps 1-4) **before** dispatching — only the per-TC writes (step 5) are parallelised; the Set-first closure (deriving the Plan/Execution test lists from the ATS membership) runs after aggregation. See SKILL.md §Subagent Dispatch Strategy for the per-phase pattern table.

**Sharding rule**: `ceil(N / 10)` subagents, each handling roughly equal-sized chunks. If `N > 100`, chunks must be larger than 10 each (cap is on subagent count, not chunk size). Each dispatch follows the 7-component briefing format in `.agents/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`.

##### Modality jira-xray (subagent loads `/xray-cli`)

Briefing (7 components per `agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`):

```
Goal: Create <K> Xray Test issues in Jira project <PROJECT_KEY> for chunk <I>/<TOTAL>, add each to the Story's ATS <ATS_KEY> (membership), link each to ATP <ATP_KEY> (designs) and ATR <ATR_KEY> (executes), and return their issue keys. Do NOT link the Tests to the Story <STORY_KEY> directly — coverage flows through the ATS→Story link (direct TC→Story is the cascade's last resort, only when no ATS exists).

Context docs:
  - .session/test-documentation/<scope>/ (session contract artifact — the TC designs Phase 1-2 wrote; the definitions for this chunk live here, NOT in test-specs/, which holds keys only)
  - .agents/jira-fields.json (custom field IDs)
  - .agents/skills/test-documentation/references/tms-architecture.md (TC body shape, naming, linking order)
  - .agents/skills/test-documentation/references/jira-test-management.md §7 (Description template)

Project Standards (auto-resolved): pulled from .agents/skills/REGISTRY.md per skill-resolver protocol

Skills to load: /xray-cli, /acli

Exact instructions:
  1. For each TC in the chunk:
     a. [TMS_TOOL] Create Test: project=<PROJECT_KEY>, type={Cucumber|Manual}, title="{per TC naming convention}", components=[{module}] (mandatory — affected product module). For Manual: create WITHOUT inline steps (Xray Cloud drops steps on create), then add each step via [TMS_TOOL] add-step. For Cucumber: pass gherkin={from the session design artifact}.
     b. Capture the returned issue key as <TEST_KEY>.
     c. [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue: issue=<TEST_KEY>, description={full Description template per jira-test-management.md §7}.
     d. [TMS_TOOL] AddTests: testSet=<ATS_KEY>, tests=[<TEST_KEY>].    # Set-first — ATS membership; Xray-internal, creates NO Jira link
     e. [TMS_TOOL] AddTests: testPlan=<ATP_KEY>, tests=[<TEST_KEY>].   # Xray-internal membership only — creates NO Jira link
     f. [TMS_TOOL] AddTests: execution=<ATR_KEY>, tests=[<TEST_KEY>].  # Xray-internal membership only — creates NO Jira link
     g. Jira-layer design/execute edges (SEPARATE from steps d/e/f): the Xray attach creates NO Jira links (confirmed, traceability-linking.md §9), so create them explicitly via [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] (/acli): [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Link Issues linkType={{jira.link_types.test_design.name}} (ATP `designs` TC) and linkType={{jira.link_types.test_execute.name}} (ATR `executes` TC), then verify direction per traceability-linking.md §2/§4.
     h. Do NOT link the Test to the Story <STORY_KEY> directly — coverage aggregates to the Story through the ATS→Story link (the ATP/ATR links are administrative only).
  2. Apply labels per the methodology naming convention (see `tms-conventions.md` §Labels) and verify components landed on every created Test (mandatory field — never leave one empty).

Report format:
  JSON array per TC:
  [
    {
      "tc_local_id": "<spec id>",
      "issue_key": "<PROJ>-<N>",
      "in_ats": true,
      "linked_to_atp": true,
      "linked_to_atr": true,
      "designs_link": true,
      "executes_link": true,
      "linked_to_story": false,
      "errors": []
    },
    ...
  ]
  Trailing summary: { "chunk": <I>, "created": K, "failed": 0|N, "duration_seconds": <int> }

Rules:
  - Do NOT modify the ATS, ATP or ATR — only add/link new tests to them.
  - Do NOT exceed 10 sustained writes/sec inside the subagent (xray-cli already throttles, but be aware).
  - On 429 or 5xx: retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times, then mark the TC as failed and continue with the rest of the chunk.
  - On 4xx (excluding 429): stop the chunk and report partial state.
  - Critical Rule #8 (File Operations): never overwrite an existing TC silently — if the summary already exists, report and skip.
```

##### Modality jira-native (no Xray plugin; subagent loads `/acli`)

Briefing (7 components per `agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`):

```
Goal: Create <K> Jira Test issues in project <PROJECT_KEY> for chunk <I>/<TOTAL>, link each to the Story's ATS <ATS_KEY> via "is tested by" (TC→ATS membership link — jira-native carve-out), and return their issue keys. Only when NO ATS exists (Test Set work type absent from the instance): link each Test to the parent Story <STORY_KEY> directly via "is tested by" (the cascade's last resort).

Context docs:
  - .session/test-documentation/<scope>/ (session contract artifact — the TC designs Phase 1-2 wrote; the definitions for this chunk live here, NOT in test-specs/, which holds keys only)
  - .agents/jira-fields.json (custom field IDs auto-discovered by `bun run jira:sync-fields`)
  - .agents/jira-required.yaml (custom-field manifest)
  - .agents/skills/test-documentation/references/jira-setup.md §3 (Modality jira-native field layout)
  - .agents/skills/test-documentation/references/jira-test-management.md §7 (Description template)

Project Standards (auto-resolved): pulled from .agents/skills/REGISTRY.md per skill-resolver protocol

Skills to load: /acli

Exact instructions:
  1. For each TC in the chunk:
     a. [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Create Issue: project=<PROJECT_KEY>, issueType=Test, summary="{per TC naming convention}", priority={Critical|High|Medium|Low}, labels=[regression, ...], components=[{module}] (mandatory — affected product module), epic=<REGRESSION_EPIC_KEY>.
     b. Capture the returned issue key as <TEST_KEY>.
     c. [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue: issue=<TEST_KEY>, description={full Description template per jira-test-management.md §7}, fields={ {{jira.test_status}}: Draft, {{jira.to_be_automated}}: <bool> }.
     d. With ATS: [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Link Issues: linkType={{jira.link_types.test.name}}, outward=<TEST_KEY>, inward=<ATS_KEY>.   # ATS is tested by Test (membership link)
        Without ATS (work type absent): [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Link Issues: linkType={{jira.link_types.test.name}}, outward=<TEST_KEY>, inward=<STORY_KEY>.   # Story is tested by Test (last resort)
  2. Do NOT recreate ATP/ATR custom fields on the Story — those were already populated by the orchestrator before dispatch. Do NOT create the ATS — the orchestrator pre-created it (Set-first).

Report format:
  JSON array per TC:
  [
    {
      "tc_local_id": "<spec id>",
      "issue_key": "<PROJ>-<N>",
      "linked_to_story": true,
      "errors": []
    },
    ...
  ]
  Trailing summary: { "chunk": <I>, "created": K, "failed": 0|N, "duration_seconds": <int> }

Rules:
  - Custom-field IDs come from .agents/jira-fields.json — do NOT hardcode `customfield_*` numbers.
  - On 429 or 5xx: retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times.
  - On 4xx (excluding 429): stop the chunk and report partial state.
  - Critical Rule #8 (File Operations): never overwrite an existing TC silently — if the summary already exists, report and skip.
  - Critical Rule #1 (Login Credentials): ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN comes from .env, never hardcode.
```

##### Aggregation in the main thread

After all parallel subagents return, the orchestrator:

1. Concatenates the JSON arrays into a single creation report.
2. Sums totals (created / failed) and computes per-chunk duration.
3. Feeds the issue-key list into the Traceability linking step (this section §4 + §5 step "for each TC").
4. If any chunk reported `failed > 0`, surface the failed TCs to the user before proceeding to traceability linking. Do NOT auto-retry across chunks; let the user decide retry / skip / abort per the error protocol in `agentic-qa-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md`.

##### Fallback to serial (N <= 10)

For N <= 10 TCs, classify inline — the dispatch overhead is not justified. The serial flows below (Modality jira-xray and Modality jira-native) remain canonical. They also describe the procedure each parallel subagent runs internally for its assigned chunk.

#### Modality jira-xray

```

#### Modality jira-native — DEGRADED FALLBACK ONLY (Test Plan / Test Execution work types unavailable)

> **Items first**: by excellence a native Jira `Test Plan` issue (`ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}`)
> and `Test Execution` issue (`ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing`) are created in jira-native too —

> Jira work types. The Story-field path below is the **degraded fallback**, used ONLY when those
> work types are absent from the instance.
>
> **ATS in jira-native**: instance **has the Test Set work type** → create the ATS item
> (`ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}`, parent QA Test Artifacts, components inherited from the
> Story), link it to the Story (`is tested by`), and express membership as **TC→ATS issue
> links** (carve-out: the "membership is never a link" rule is xray-only). Work type
> **absent** → **no ATS**: link each TC directly to the Story (the cascade's last-resort
> edge, as in the block below).
>
> **Prerequisite**: Load `/acli` skill before executing commands below.

### Update

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/xray-cli` skill (Modality jira-xray). In Modality jira-native, load `/acli` — these update calls become `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue` on the Story or Test customfields.

```
[TMS_TOOL] Update ATP:
  id: {from ATP ID}
  results: {from ATR name}
  analysis: {from test analysis content}
  complete: true

[TMS_TOOL] Update ATR:
  id: {from ATR ID}
  report: {from test report content}
  complete: true

[TMS_TOOL] Update TC:
  id: {from TC ID}
  status: PASSED
  workflow-status: Candidate
  precondition: {from test environment details}
  spec: {from step-by-step specification}
```

### Verify traceability

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/xray-cli` skill (Modality jira-xray). In Modality jira-native, load `/acli` and walk the links manually via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Search Issues`.

```
[TMS_TOOL] Verify Traceability:
  issue: {from ticket ID}
```

Expected output: all links verified — US `is tested by` ATS (coverage), ATP and ATR (administrative); each TC a member of the ATS, `is designed by` ATP and `is executed by` ATR; no direct US↔TC link needed while the ATS covers them (a direct link is valid only as the cascade's last resort, when no ATS exists). If any link is missing, apply the fixes in §10.

## 10. Fixing broken traceability

Common failure modes and their fixes:

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| TC has NO path to its Story (not in an ATS, not in an ATP, no direct link) | **This is the actual defect** — it is an ORPHAN. Resolve by the cascade: add it to the Story's ATS (create the ATS if missing); else no ATS possible → link TC→Story directly (`is tested by`, last resort) |
| Story has no ATS | Create `ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}` (parent QA Test Artifacts, components from the Story), link it to the Story (`is tested by`), add ALL the Story's TCs |
| TC not a member of the Story's ATS | Add it (jira-xray: Xray-internal via `/xray-cli`; jira-native: TC→ATS issue link) |
| TC linked directly to Story WHILE an ATS covers it | Redundant, not fatal — prefer moving the TC into the ATS and dropping the direct link. A direct TC→Story link on its own is the cascade's documented last resort (no ATS), NOT a defect to remove |
| TC not designed-by ATP | Link ATP `designs` TC (`test_design`) |
| TC not executed-by ATR | Link ATR `executes` TC (`test_execute`) |
| ATP not linked to ATR | Update ATP with ATR reference |
| ATS not linked to Story | Link Story `is tested by` ATS (`test`) — without it the coverage panel shows Not Covered |
| ATP not linked to Story | Link Story `is tested by` ATP (`test`) |
| ATR not linked to Story | Link Story `is tested by` ATR (`test`) |
| TC name doesn't follow convention | Rename TC to `{US_ID}: TC#: should <expected outcome> [<connector> <condition>] [given <precondition>]` |
| ATP name wrong | Rename to `ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}` |
| ATR name wrong | Rename to `ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing` |
| ATS name wrong | Rename to `ATS: {US_ID}: {story title}` |
| TC has no AC link | Identify which AC it covers and add the reference |

Procedure:

1. Run `[TMS_TOOL] Verify Traceability` — read the gap list.
2. For each issue, apply the fix above.
3. Re-run `[TMS_TOOL] Verify Traceability` to confirm all links are resolved.
4. Log what was fixed in a comment on the User Story for audit trail.

## 11. Reference implementation — Jira + Xray

The canonical implementation this file was derived from uses Jira with Xray. Mapping:

| Generic concept | Jira/Xray implementation |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Test Case ID | Jira issue key (e.g., `PROJ-123`) |
| Test Case issue type | Xray Test |
| Test Plan | Jira `Test Plan` issue (items first; Story custom field = degraded fallback only) |
| Test Execution (ATR) | Jira `Test Execution` issue (Xray adds the run engine) |
| Test Set (ATS) | Jira `Test Set` issue — mandatory per Story; its `is tested by` link to the Story is the coverage-panel anchor |
| Regression Epic | Jira Epic resolved by configured name (`qa.qa_epics.test_repository_epic.name` — "QA Test Repository"), then cached key; carries the `QA-Artifact` label |
| Results import | Xray REST API (JUnit / Cucumber formats) |
| CLI | `bun xray` (load `/xray-cli` skill) |

Other TMS tools (Coda, Azure DevOps, TestRail) implement the same five-entity model with different issue types. The naming conventions, linking order, and traceability rules above apply unchanged.
