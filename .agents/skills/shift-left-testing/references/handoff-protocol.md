# Handoff Protocol — Phase 3 (Per-Story Jira Mutation + Batch Report)

> **Subagent context**: this file is the "Context docs" reference for the Phase 3 Handoff subagent + Batch Report subagent (see `shift-left-testing/SKILL.md` §Subagent Dispatch Strategy and §Phase 3). Owns Jira mutations + final report only — refinement content comes from `atp-outline-template.md` and the per-Story `shift-left-refinement.md`.

The Handoff subagent runs ONCE PER REFINED STORY. The Batch Report subagent runs ONCE PER SESSION at the end. Both are dispatched sequentially.

This reference defines:
1. Per-Story Jira mutation sequence (description update, ATP field population, handoff comment, labels, transition, subtask close, trace verify).
2. Modality handling — the ATP write is **field-first in BOTH modalities**; modality only matters downstream, when `/sprint-testing` Stage 1 creates the Test Plan item from the field.
3. Transition guardrails (stop at `estimation`).
4. Batch report template + epic-comment posting rules.

## Inputs (per Story)

| Input | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Refined refinement file (NON-Jira working file) | `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<EPIC_KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<STORY_KEY>-<slug>/shift-left-refinement.md` |
| Current Story status | `bun run jira:sync-issues get {STORY_KEY}`, then read synced status (or `acli search` for the trivial status-only lookup) |
| Current Story labels | Same synced read — labels list |
| Modality | From the session's `progress.md` (`.session/shift-left-testing/<batch-id>/`, resolved in shift-left-testing Phase 0.1). Informational here — the ATP write is field-first in both modalities |
| TMS field map | `.agents/jira-fields.json` → `{{jira.acceptance_criteria}}`, `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` |
| Workflow transitions | `.agents/jira-workflows.json` → `{{jira.transition.story.analyze}}`, `{{jira.transition.story.estimate}}` |
| Tracking subtask | The `[QA] Shift-Left Review` subtask created in Phase 1 (In Progress). Work type + Done transition from `.agents/jira-workflows.json`; if the catalog has no subtask work type, Phase 1 skipped it — Step 5b then skips with a warning too |

---

## Per-Story handoff sequence

> **Prerequisite**: `/acli` skill loaded (Phase 0.2). `/xray-cli` is never needed here — this protocol creates no TMS items.

### Step 1a — Write refined ACs to the Jira `acceptance_criteria` field

The refined Acceptance Criteria are CANONICAL and belong in the dedicated Jira field — Jira is source of truth; the local `acceptance-criteria.md` is a read-only cache produced by the sync. NEVER hand-write that file.

```
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue:
  issue: {STORY_KEY}
  fields:
    {{jira.acceptance_criteria}}: <Refined ACs — Phase 3 of shift-left-refinement.md verbatim>
```

FALLBACK (field absent on this instance): post the refined ACs as a structured comment headed `## Acceptance Criteria`, per `.agents/jira-required.yaml` → `acceptance_criteria.fallback` (`{ target: comment, label: "Acceptance Criteria" }`). Never block.

After writing, run `bun run jira:sync-issues get {STORY_KEY} --include-comments` and read back the synced `acceptance-criteria.md` to confirm the field (or fallback comment) landed.

### Step 1b — Append supporting analysis to Story description

Append a "QA Refinements (Shift-Left Analysis)" section to the Story description. The section body is a CONDENSED extract of the SUPPORTING analysis from `shift-left-refinement.md` (refined ACs themselves live in the `acceptance_criteria` field from Step 1a) — the full body goes into the ATP (Step 2); the Step 3 comment is a pointer to it. Description should be readable in the Jira UI without scrolling forever.

Description section template:

```markdown
---

## QA Refinements (Shift-Left Analysis) — Added {{YYYY-MM-DD}}

> Refined Acceptance Criteria live in the `acceptance_criteria` field (Step 1a).

### Edge Cases Identified
{Copy Phase 5 edge-case table verbatim.}

### Clarified Business Rules
{Any rule extracted from Phase 2 Story Quality Analysis that the original Story did not state explicitly.}

### Critical Questions for PO
{Numbered list — copy verbatim from shift-left-refinement.md §Critical Questions for PO.}

### Technical Questions for Dev
{Numbered list — copy verbatim from §Technical Questions for Dev.}

> Full refinement (Phases 1-5, coverage outlines, risk + data feasibility) lives in the ATP — the `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field (Step 2; `/sprint-testing` Stage 1 later materializes it as the Test Plan issue).
```

```
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue:
  issue: {STORY_KEY}
  description: <existing description + "\n\n" + QA Refinements section>
```

The Handoff subagent must read the current description FIRST (from the synced `.md`), then append. Never overwrite.

### Step 2 — Populate the ATP (field-first — both modalities)

> **ONE ATP per Story, authored early — as FIELD content, never as an item.** Shift-Left does not create a separate DRAFT artifact, and it does not create the Test Plan issue either. Pre-sprint, the ATP's home is the `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` custom field on the Story. `/sprint-testing` Stage 1 creates the real **Test Plan** issue (titled `ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}`, parented to the **QA Master Test Plan** epic, linked to the Story) FROM this field content, and refines the same ATP into the executable superset. There is no `(Shift-Left DRAFT)` title variant and no second Test Plan to reconcile later.
>
> **Why field-first pre-sprint**: PO has not estimated yet and scope may shrink — creating the item this early wastes an artifact and leaves a second copy for Stage 1 to reconcile. The field IS the only pre-sprint ATP write, in BOTH modalities; modality only decides which engine Stage 1 uses later.
>
> What marks this ATP as pre-sprint is the Story's `shift-left-reviewed` + `shift-left-{YYYY-MM-DD}` labels, not the title. Those labels are what Stage 1 reads to decide whether to short-circuit.

The write is identical in Modality jira-xray and Modality jira-native:

```
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue:
  issue: {STORY_KEY}
  fields:
    {{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}: <full shift-left-refinement.md body>
```

FALLBACK (the instance has not provisioned `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}`): skip the field write and switch Step 3 to fallback mode — the `## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)` comment carries the full body inline, per `.agents/jira-required.yaml` → `acceptance_test_plan.fallback` (`{ target: comment, label: "Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)" }`). Warn the user in the per-Story summary. Never block.

### Step 3 — Handoff notification + fallback comment

Jira is the source of truth: the ATP lives in the `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field (Step 2) — do NOT mirror it into a comment when the field exists. Post ONE handoff comment on the Story:

- **Field present (default)**: a SHORT notification — the pre-sprint ATP is ready for review in the `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field. Do NOT paste the full body.
- **FALLBACK — only if `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` is absent on this instance** (per `.agents/jira-required.yaml` → `acceptance_test_plan.fallback`, `{ target: comment, label: "Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)" }`): inline the full body under a `## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)` heading so the content still lands somewhere readable.

```
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Add Comment:
  issue: {STORY_KEY}
  body: |
    ## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP) — ready for pre-sprint review
    {@PO_HANDLE} {@DEV_LEAD_HANDLE}
    The ATP lives in the {{jira.acceptance_test_plan}} field.
    # FALLBACK ONLY (field absent): replace the pointer line above with the full staged refinement body.

    Action Required: review ambiguities, answer critical questions, confirm edge-case behavior, validate parametrization.
    Refined on: {{YYYY-MM-DD}} — QA Shift-Left batch session
    This ATP is refined in-sprint by /sprint-testing Stage 1, which creates the
    Test Plan issue from this field and refines it into the executable superset.
```

`fix-traceability` checks the `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field, or this `## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)` fallback comment when the field is absent.

Mention rule: include `@PO_HANDLE` and `@DEV_LEAD_HANDLE` in the comment IF those handles are available in `.agents/project.yaml`. Otherwise omit — mention-spam is worse than no mention.

### Step 4 — Labels

```
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue:
  issue: {STORY_KEY}
  labels: +shift-left-reviewed, +shift-left-{{YYYY-MM-DD}}
```

- `shift-left-reviewed` is the SOFT MARKER — `/sprint-testing` Stage 1 reads it.
- `shift-left-{{YYYY-MM-DD}}` is the FRESHNESS MARKER — `/sprint-testing` uses the date to decide whether refinement is still <30 days old and can be short-circuited.

Both labels are appended (never replaced). If the Story already carries an older `shift-left-{date}`, leave it — it documents the refinement timeline.

### Step 5 — Transition

> **Guardrail**: NEVER advance beyond `{{jira.status.story.estimation}}`. PO + Dev lead own `estimate -> ready_for_dev`.

Read current status, then transition along the shortest valid path to `estimation`:

| Current status | Transitions to apply | Resolved IDs |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| `{{jira.status.story.backlog}}` | `{{jira.transition.story.analyze}}` → `{{jira.transition.story.estimate}}` | id 2 (Analyze), then id 3 (Estimate) |
| `{{jira.status.story.shift_left_qa}}` | `{{jira.transition.story.estimate}}` | id 3 (Estimate) |
| `{{jira.status.story.estimation}}` | (none — already there) | — |
| `{{jira.status.story.ready_for_dev}}`, `{{jira.status.story.in_progress}}`, `{{jira.status.story.in_review}}`, `{{jira.status.story.ready_for_qa}}`, ... | SKIP transition — log warning | refinement still lands; workflow untouched |
| `{{jira.status.story.aborted}}`, `{{jira.status.story.deployed_to_production}}` | SKIP transition + WARN user — terminal | refinement is informational only |

Pseudocode:

```
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] read status: {STORY_KEY}    # trivial status-only lookup — acli search OK
if status == backlog:
    [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Transition: {{jira.transition.story.analyze}}    # -> shift_left_qa
    [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Transition: {{jira.transition.story.estimate}}   # -> estimation
elif status == shift_left_qa:
    [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Transition: {{jira.transition.story.estimate}}   # -> estimation
elif status == estimation:
    # noop — already at target
elif status in (ready_for_dev, in_progress, in_review, ready_for_qa, qa_approved, in_test, ready_for_release, deployed_to_production, blocked, aborted):
    log warning "Story past estimation — refinement landed; workflow untouched"
else:
    log warning "Unknown status {status}; SKIP transition"
```

The skill NEVER applies the `back_from_shift_left_qa` transition automatically. That is a PO / Dev decision (Story does not meet readiness for estimation — go back to backlog).

### Step 5b — Close the `[QA] Shift-Left Review` subtask

Phase 1 found-or-created this subtask under the Story and moved it to In Progress. The handoff closes it:

1. Locate the subtask under the Story by exact title `[QA] Shift-Left Review`.
2. **Post the exhaustive session annotations on the SUBTASK first** — the long analysis, refinement traces, and per-phase notes that are too verbose for the Story. The Story keeps only its canonical outputs (refined ACs field, description section, ATP field, pointer comment, labels); the subtask is where the full working trail lives.

```
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Add Comment (or Update description):
  issue: {SUBTASK_KEY}
  body: <exhaustive session annotations — analysis trail, refinement traces>

[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Transition: <subtask Done transition>   # resolved from .agents/jira-workflows.json
```

3. If Phase 1 skipped subtask creation (no subtask work type in `.agents/jira-workflows.json`, or the project disallows subtasks): skip this step with a warning in the per-Story log. Never block the handoff on subtask support.

### Step 6 — Verify trace

Both modalities (field-first — there is no Test Plan item to trace pre-sprint):

```
bun run jira:sync-issues get {STORY_KEY} --include-comments
# then read the synced field files + comments.md. Verify:
#   - acceptance_criteria field (or "## Acceptance Criteria" fallback comment) != empty
#   - field {{jira.acceptance_test_plan}} != empty
#     (or the "## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)" fallback comment carries the full body
#      when the field is absent on this instance)
#   - handoff comment "## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)" present and points to the field
#     (full body inline ONLY in fallback mode — field absent on this instance)
#   - "[QA] Shift-Left Review" subtask (when created) is in Done
```

### Step 7 — Return per-Story log

```json
{
  "story": "UPEX-100",
  "atp_container": "custom_field|fallback_comment",
  "subtask_key": "UPEX-205 (null when skipped — no subtask work type)",
  "subtask_status": "Done|skipped",
  "description_appended": true,
  "comment_posted": true,
  "labels_added": ["shift-left-reviewed", "shift-left-2026-05-20"],
  "transitions_applied": ["analyze", "estimate"],
  "final_status": "Estimation",
  "trace_status": "ok|warning|fail",
  "warnings": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

Warnings DO NOT abort the per-Story handoff — they are surfaced in the batch report.

Errors DO abort. Per AGENTS.md §Orchestration Mode, the orchestrator presents retry / skip / abort to the user. Do NOT auto-rollback Jira mutations — they are recorded in the partial log so a future session can resume.

## Batch report

Dispatched ONCE after every Story has run Phase 3.

### Output path

```
.session/shift-left-testing/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<descriptor>/batch-report.md
```

### Template

- **Mode**: Modality {A | B}
- **Candidate count**: {n}
- **Accepted for refinement**: {n}
- **Rejected (non-Story)**: {n}

## Per-Story summary

| # | Story | Title | Risk | Gaps | Critical PO Qs | Tech Qs | Outlines | Data-feasibility flag | Final status | Trace |
|---|-------|-------|------|------|----------------|---------|----------|----------------------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | UPEX-100 | Add OTP login | HIGH | 4 | 2 | 3 | 12 | — | Estimation | ok |
| 2 | UPEX-101 | Refund partial amount | HIGH | 6 | 3 | 2 | 14 | DATA-FEASIBILITY | Estimation | warning |
| 3 | UPEX-102 | Filter orders by status | MEDIUM | 2 | 0 | 1 | 6 | — | Estimation | ok |

## Aggregated Critical Questions for PO (deduped)

Top questions across the batch, ranked by how many Stories they block:

1. **Q: What is the refund cap policy — % of original or hard limit?**
   - Blocks: UPEX-101, UPEX-118 (2 Stories)
   - Suggested action: PO decision required before sprint planning.
2. **Q: What is the session expiry threshold for OTP flow?**
   - Blocks: UPEX-100 (1 Story)
   - Suggested action: PO + Security decision; default-safe = 5 minutes.

## Aggregated Technical Questions for Dev (deduped)

1. **Q: Which Auth0 SDK version is pinned?**
   - Blocks: UPEX-100, UPEX-114 (2 Stories)
2. ...

## Risk distribution

| Level | Count | Stories |
|-------|-------|---------|
| HIGH | 2 | UPEX-100, UPEX-101 |
| MEDIUM | 1 | UPEX-102 |
| LOW (skipped) | 1 | UPEX-117 |

## Data feasibility blockers

Stories flagged with `DATA-FEASIBILITY-RISK` during selection that still carry the flag post-refinement:

| Story | Blocker | Required pre-work |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| UPEX-101 | Refund-history fixture missing in staging | Backend team to seed; ETA: ? |

## Recommended sprint-planning order

Sorted by risk + dependency:

1. **UPEX-100** — HIGH, no dependencies, refinement clean → ready for estimation
2. **UPEX-101** — HIGH but data-feasibility flag → estimate after pre-work confirmed
3. **UPEX-102** — MEDIUM → can wait, low coupling

## Next steps

- [ ] PO answers Aggregated Critical Questions before sprint planning
- [ ] Dev lead answers Aggregated Tech Questions before estimation
- [ ] When each Story reaches `Ready For QA`, run `/sprint-testing` — Stage 1 will detect `shift-left-reviewed` label and short-circuit Phases 1-3 of `acceptance-test-planning.md`
- [ ] If any Story still carries a data-feasibility blocker at sprint-planning time, consider moving it to a later sprint
```

### Posting rules

1. **Always write** the file under `.session/shift-left-testing/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<descriptor>/batch-report.md`.
2. **If all refined Stories share ONE parent epic**, post the batch report as a comment on that epic — the team grooms by epic, so the report lands where decision-makers look.
3. **If Stories span multiple epics or have no common parent**, do NOT post to any epic — deliver inline to the user as the session-closing message.
4. **Never post the report on every Story**. The per-Story handoff comment already landed in Step 3; the batch report is a session-level artifact.

---

## Resume protocol

The session is resumable. If interrupted (subagent failure, user abort, network drop), the next invocation:

1. Reads the session's `progress.md` (`.session/shift-left-testing/<batch-id>/`) to know which Stories are pending vs handed-off.
2. Reads each pending Story's `shift-left-refinement.md` (if it exists) to know Phase 2 is done.
3. Continues from the first incomplete step (Step 1 if description not yet updated, Step 2 if ATP not populated, ...).

Each step is idempotent:

| Step | Idempotency rule |
|------|------------------|
| Step 1 description | If "QA Refinements (Shift-Left Analysis)" section already present → skip |
| Step 2 ATP field | Overwrite OK — field is single-value |
| Step 3 comment | If a comment headed `## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)` already exists → skip |
| Step 4 labels | acli labels operation is set-based; re-running adds nothing |
| Step 5 transition | Read current status before transitioning; skip if already at target |
| Step 5b subtask | Find by exact title (created in Phase 1); skip transition if already Done; append annotations as a new comment, never overwrite |
| Step 6 trace | Always re-verify |

---

## Gotchas

1. **Description append, never overwrite.** Read first, append second.
2. **The comment is a pointer, not a mirror.** When `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` exists, the handoff comment only points to the field — never paste the full body. The full body goes in the comment ONLY in fallback mode (field absent). `fix-traceability` checks the field, or the fallback comment when the field is absent.
3. **Transition guardrail.** STOP at `estimation`. Stories past that point keep the refinement (description + field + comment + labels) but skip transition.
4. **No TMS items pre-sprint.** This protocol never creates the Test Plan issue — `/sprint-testing` Stage 1 creates it from the `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field content. If an older session already left a pre-sprint Test Plan on the Story, leave it, note it in the per-Story log, and let Stage 1 reconcile.
5. **Mention discipline.** Only mention PO/Dev-lead handles that are explicitly listed in `.agents/project.yaml`. No guessing.
6. **Dated label** (`shift-left-{date}`) is APPENDED on every refinement. `/sprint-testing` reads the most recent one. Old dated labels are NOT pruned by this skill.
7. **Resume safety.** Every step is idempotent — re-running a partially-completed Story should converge to the same final state.
8. **Language**: all Jira content English. Mirror user's language only in conversation. AGENTS.md §1 Rule #14.
9. **NO git commit.** Jira is the source of truth. The local `shift-left-refinement.md` is a gitignored working artifact.
10. **Epic comment posting** is a courtesy. If it fails (epic doesn't exist, permission denied, network), DO NOT abort — log a warning and proceed; the local report is still authoritative.
11. **Subtask close is best-effort.** The `[QA] Shift-Left Review` subtask holds the exhaustive session annotations and shows the team QA worked the Story pre-sprint. No subtask work type in the catalog → Step 5b skips with a warning; the handoff still completes.
